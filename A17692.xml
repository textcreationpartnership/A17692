            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ROVLAND HALL TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THere be thre cauſes ſpecially that moueth me to printe theſe ſermons of maiſter Ihon Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine the faithful ſeruant of god and the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of our time. Th'one is the worthines of the mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter ſet furth in theſe ſermons. The other is the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſimplicitie that thys great clarke vſeth in all his ſermons to the people. The third is the reuerent handling of the ſcriptures, without tauntes, ſkoffes, or ieſtes, or any trifling tales, wherby our engliſh na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion may ſe &amp; iudge what power the word of god hath of it ſelf, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is moſt naked &amp; bare and void of that painted ſheathe that men would put vpon it. The matter is mete for al men to know, and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth in theſe foure pointes. Fyrſt, there is a generall admonicion to flye idolatry. Secondly an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to folow Chriſt in ſuffering of perſecution, and bearing of the croſſe. Thirdlye the liberty to ſerue god, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie to liue in the church of god is commended. Fourthly with how great paines &amp; care this liberty to worſhip god purely in ſom chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſten congregation oght to be ſoght for and deſired of all chriſtians, is deſcribed. And for a concluſion there is addded the expoſition of the .87. pſalme, which teacheth that the church of god thogh it ſeme miſerable in this world, yet doth it excel al the kyngdoms of the earth becauſe god loueth it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth it, ſtabliſheth it, multiplieth it, and taketh the count and numbre of his elect people out of it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:18640:3"/>
            <p>Concernyng the ſecond poynt. The ſimplicitie is ſuch, as our Sauiour Chriſt and hys apoſtles vſed in their ſermons, of the which ſainct Paule ſpeaketh to the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſaying that he came not with ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cellencie of wordes, or of mans wiſedome to ſhew vnto them the teſtimonie of God, leſt the croſſe of Chriſt and the power of God workyng thereby ſholde be of none effect, whyles men ſhould attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute that to eloquence which only is wrought by the ſpirite of god in the heartes of the faythful.</p>
            <p>For the thyrd: he obſerueth the precept of ſainct Peter. Yf any man ſpeake, let him ſpeake as the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of God So that all hys ſermons ſeme nothyng els but the ſwete licour of the ſcriptures and liuely word of god ſet furthe before our eyes in Chriſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line veſſels to entice vs to beholde them and to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoke vs to taſt and to ſmel of theſe lycours of lyfe whiche he brocheth vnto vs of that abundance which god hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him in theſe our times. God grant vs grace thankefully to receyue Gods good gyftes in this and all other thynges offered vnto vs. So be it.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE DOCTRINE VVHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch</hi> we ſhal entreate in this place, is playne ynough and eaſie, ſauyng that the greateſt parte of thoſe that profeſſe them ſelues to be Chriſtians, do ſeke out and bring, I can not tell what ſubtelties to cloke theyr euill withall. But the ſumme of this wholle doctrine is, that after we knowe the liuing god to be our father, and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our redemer, we oght to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate bothe body and ſoule vnto hym, who of his infinite goodnes hath taken vs into the numbre of hys ſonnes: and to acknowledg with all kinde of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence, honour, and obedience, that
<pb facs="tcp:18640:4"/> ſame benefit which our moſt deare ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did vouchſaffe to beſtow on vs after he had bought it with ſo greate a price. And becauſe we ar bound not only to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nounce al infidelitie, but alſo to ſeperat our ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al ſuperſtitions, which do aſwell diſagre w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the true ſeruice of god the father, as the honor of his ſonne our ſauiour &amp; which can by no meanes agre w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the pure doctrine of the goſpell &amp; true confeſſion of the faith, I ſayde this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of it ſelfe to be ſo eaſye, that only the practiſe and exerciſe thereof oght to remaine vnto vs, ſauing that many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do ſeke certain deceitful ſhiftes, thorow which they wil not be ouercome in that thyng, the which is moſt chiefly condem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned by gods owne mouth. This cauſe conſtraineth vs at this time to tary lon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger in the declaration of this matter, that euery man may know his own du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie, and deceaue not himſelfe, thinking that he is eſcaped when he is couered, as the common ſaying is, vnder a wette ſack. But for that there be many of this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe churches ar thorowly pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the filthines, &amp; idolatries of the papiſme, that this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or treatice
<pb facs="tcp:18640:4"/> is but ſuperfluous, before we paſſe any further, it is not vnprofitable to declare ſuch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt fouly to be deceiued. Firſt whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is declared, how great an offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it is, for vs to be polluted &amp; defiled with the idolatours, feininge oure ſelues to cleaue &amp; conſent to their impieties, we ar admoniſhed to mourn for our former ſyns, &amp; to aſke of god forgeuenes of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with al humblenes, &amp; in this thing to ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>knowledge the ſinguler benefite which he gaue vnto vs, drawing vs forth of that ſame filth wherin we were holden down &amp; drowned. For we truly are not hable to ſet forth this ſo great a benefit wortheli inough. And for that we know not what ſhall happen vnto vs, and to what end God doth reſerue vs, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expedient to be prepared and armed in tyme, that into what ſtate ſoeuer we ſhal come, or with what ſoeuer tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tations we maye be oppugned, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſwarue from the pure worde of god. Fyrſt it may be that many of thys oure churche and congregation, ſhall tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueil into ſome papiſtical countrey, who oght greatly nowe to be in a readines &amp; armed to batel. Then albeit God doeth
<pb facs="tcp:18640:5"/> geue vs at this time liberty to ſerue him purely and godlilye, yet we knowe not how long this our benefite ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue. Let vs therfore take this time of our qui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>etnes and tranquillitie, not as thogh it ſhal alwaies laſt, but as it wer a time of truce, wherein god doth geue vs leaſure to ſtrengthen our ſelues, leſt when we ſhalbe called to vtter the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of our faith, we be found new and vnprepared becauſe we contemned the meditacion of that matter in due time. Nether tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ought we to forget in the mean while our brethren which are kepte vnder the tyranny of Antichriſt, oppreſſed wyth moſt miſerable bondage, but to take, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, pitie ouer them, and to prai god to ſtrengthen them with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, which he requireth in his word. We muſte alſo admoniſhe and ſolicite them by al wayes, not to reſt in places where men are faſt on ſlepe in their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſſe, but to applie diligently this thought, and wyl, that thei confeſſe the glorie due vnto god. For we are not taught of god onely for our ſelues, but that euery man after the meaſure of his faith, ſhuld brotherly communicat with
<pb facs="tcp:18640:5"/> his neighbors, and diſtribute vnto them that thing he hath learned and knowen in gods ſchole. Nowe ſe we then that it is profitable, yea truly neceſſary ſo well to our ſelues, as to our brethren, that the remembrance of this doctrine ſhulde be renued very oft, eſpeciallye ſeyng the text it ſelfe which we ſhal expound, doth leade vs to the ſame purpoſe. Dauid doth openly proteſt, and as it wer doth make a ſolemne vow, that he wil neuer be par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taker in the ſacrifices of Idolaters, and alſo that he wyll ſo deteſt, and greuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hate the idols that he wyl not at anye time once name the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as though he ſhuld defile his mouth in naming them.</p>
            <p>This is not the fact of ſom one man but the example of Dauid the moſt excellent kinge and prophet which oght to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to al gods children a certain comon rule to ryght and godly life. And to thentent we may the better perceaue this thyng and more vehemently be moued with, the true fear of god the cauſe is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which he addeth wherein truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth as it were a certain foundation of that ſame alienation and offence wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he doth moſt greatly abhorre the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munion
<pb facs="tcp:18640:6"/> of idolatours. The lorde, ſaieth he is myne enheritaunce. But is not, this thing comon to all faithful and god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye men. There is no man truly whych wold not glorie in ſo excellent athyng. And this is ſure without al doubt, that god being once geuen vnto vs in the per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon of his ſonne, doth dayly entiſe vs to poſſeſſ him. But ther be veray fewe whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch ar ſo affected in this part, as the great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes and worthines of this ſame mater ſhuld ſeme to aſke and deſerue. Nether truly can we by any meanes poſſeſſ god, onles on this condition that we alſo be come hys. Dauid therfore of good right and worthely did ſet the foundation of hys godlynes, and religion in this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and reaſon ſeing that god is his en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>heritaunce, he wil refrain from all pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of idoles which do turne vs, from God hymſelfe. This is the cauſe why the prophet Eſay, when he had vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided the iewes that they had geuen themſelues to fals and ſtrange goddes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had made, added afterwarde, theis, ſaith he, ar thy portion ſignifieng by theſe words, that god doth deny to the worſhippers of idoles all bond &amp; felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyppe
<pb facs="tcp:18640:6"/> of couenante and diſenheryteth them, and vtterly depriueth them, of that ſo infinitly great benefite, whiche he wold haue beſtowed on them, geuing him ſelfe vnto them. Som man will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and ſai that the prophet entreateth in that place only of them which put, their affiance in idoles, and deceaueth them ſelues thorow opinion and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie. I graunt but this alſo I anſwar yf they that do tranſferre gods honour: vnto idoles, are vtterly ſeparated and cut of from his felowſhip, they alſo doe are and decline ſome what from him, which doe feine them ſelues to conſent to ſuperſticions thorow feare and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneſſe of mynde.</p>
            <p>For no man can in heart or any confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable faſhion or in wyll, and in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of minde, or faining, or by any true or fained waye approch to idols, but he muſt ſo far go back fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god. Wherefore let this ſentence be thorowly perſuaded and remaine depely printed in our hear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, that thei which ſeke god with a tru and pure minde, to the ende to poſſeſſe him for their enheritance, wyll haue no communion and felowſhip with idoles,
<pb facs="tcp:18640:7"/> with whome god hath that diuorce and debate, that he wold haue al his to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim and make continuall and deadlye war vpon them. And in this place Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid by name doth expreſſe, that he wyll neuer be partaker of their oblations, ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther haue theyr names in his mouth and talking. He might haue ſaid on this wiſe, I wil not deceyue my ſelf with vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wiſe and foliſhe deuocions of the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuers, I will not put my truſt in ſuche abuſes, nor I wil neuer forſake goddes truth, to folow theſe lies, but he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not on this maner, but doth rather promiſe conſtantly, that he wyll neuer be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſant among theyr ceremonies. Therfore he doth teſtifie ſo far furth as concerneth the ſeruice of god, he will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide continually in al puritie and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes both of bodye and ſoule. And firſt in this place we muſte conſider, whether this be not idolatrie to ſignifie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare by outward tokens, our agreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with thoſe ſuperſticions, wherwith the ſeruice of god is corrupted &amp; vtterly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted. Thei that ſwim (as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſaying) betwixt two waters, allege this ſaiyng, ſeing that god wold be honored
<pb facs="tcp:18640:7"/> in ſpirit, idols ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by no meanes be hono<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red vnles a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> put his truſt in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But to this may be eaſly anſwered, that god doth not ſo require the ſpiritual ſeruice &amp; adoration of the minde, that he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and remitteth the other part of our nature vnto idols, as though that part ſhuld ſeme nothing at al to belong vnto him. For it is ſaid in many places, that the knees muſt be bowed before god &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo the hands lifted vp to heauen. What then? ſurely the chief honor that god re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth is ſpiritual but the outward ſig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nification wherbey the faithful do teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that it is god only who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei ſerue and honour, muſt ſo immediatly folow, that thei muſt at one time be ioined together But one place ſhal ſo ſuffice for al, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fute that obiection which thei ſnatch of one word, that thei ſhalbe plainly rebu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked &amp; conuict. In the .iii. chap. of Daniel it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Sidrach, Miſach &amp; Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denego, refuſed &amp; denied vnder any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of colour, to conſent vnto the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtition ſet vp &amp; erected by Nabuchodono<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſor, declaring that thei wold in no wiſe honor his gods. If theſe goodly wittie ſophiſters had bene there at that time,
<pb facs="tcp:18640:8"/> wold haue laught to ſcorne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſimplicitie of theſe thre ſeruants of god. For I ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe thei wold haue taunted them with ſuch like words, you foliſh me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly is not to honor them, ſeing you put no affiance in theſe thynges. There is no idolatrie but where there is deuocio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is to ſay, a certain bending &amp; appli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cation of the minde to honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe the idoles. But theſe godly men did folowe a better &amp; wiſer counſell, for this anſwer which thei made, proceded not of their owne wit, but rather of the holy goſt, which moued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus to ſpea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if we wil not reſiſt, we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this place &amp; this example, as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten rule &amp; definicion, that idolatry is an outward action againſt gods honor, yea although it procede not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wil and purpoſe of the mind, but be only colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and feined. In which matter thei make goodly cauilatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that ther is no idolatrie at all when as our affiance is not put in idols. Yet ſhal theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually remaine condemned by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which the mightieſt iudge hath pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend only for the name, only going about ſomdeal to
<pb facs="tcp:18640:8"/> leſſon their faute, which thei can by no meanes defend or excuſe. Yea, thei wil grant that this thing is euil done &amp; not rightly, yet notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding thei wolde haue this fact to be iudged as a certeine veninal ſyn. But althogh we grant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as touching the name y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thing thei aſke yet thei ſhal not get ſo much therby that thei mai make their cauſe much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Let vs ſai thus, that ſuch maner of feined worſhippi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of idols, is not called idolatry, yet neuertheles it ſhalbe a trai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terous enterpriſe againſt god, a certain fact repugnant to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of faith, &amp; a foul filthy polutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt ful of wicked ſacrilege. I pray you when the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſeruice &amp; honor of god is ſo violated that we falſly break y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſe we made to him, that thorowe cowardiſe &amp; faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſtomack we denie croeedly &amp; faſly our chriſtian profeſſion, that we becom inconſtant and double, that we defyle our ſelues foulye with thoſe thinges, which god hath curſed with all kinde of maledictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: is this ſo light a matter that after we haue done it, we oght onely to wipe oure mouth, and confeſſe that we haue committed a certaine ſmall fault?
<pb facs="tcp:18640:9"/> Let vs therfore put away theſe ſhiftes, ſpecially ſeing they ſerue for no nother thinge, but to make vs boulder, and to geue vs greater, libertie to ſinne, and doth nothing, at al diminiſh our fault? Ther be alſo other more impudent, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che do not only, chaunging the name go about to perſuade that it is not ſo great and vnworthy a ſinne: but do plainly &amp; preciſely deny it to be ſinne. It is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ent ſaye they that god be honoured with hart and, minde. Euen ſo trulye if the hart it ſelfe were not dowble. For when the minde is truely ſounde and pure the bodye ſhall neuer be drawen into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part. I wold know of them what that is that moueth &amp; leadeth their fete to the temple. For when thei go to here mas, their legges wil neuer be ſtirred of theyr owne motion, but muſt nedes be moued bi the inward power of the mind: Then muſt thei nedes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fes that ther is in them ſelues a certain deſir &amp; motion, of minde wher of thei be caried to wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip idoles, &amp; chefely becauſe they couet to apply them ſelues after their wil and opinion, which are enemies to the truth yea and do ſo conforme them ſelues to,
<pb facs="tcp:18640:9"/> pleaſe them, that they do muche more eſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teme ther fauour and ther owne lif then gods honour and glorye. Beſides thys, their impudencye is ſo manifeſt &amp; ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that i am aſhamed to diſput againſt it, as though it had ſome colour or lyk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of reaſon, yet I muſt nedes do it, ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yng they do pleaſe them ſelues ſo great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, and are, as it were men dronken in their owne opiniones and pleaſures, fal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>len faſt on ſlepe. They thinke this is i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nogh to worſhip god in ſprit, whoſ then ſhall the body be? Truli. S. Paull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to honour god, both in body and ſpirit, for they be his owne &amp; belongeth to none other. God hath created the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſhal it be leafull for vs therwith to ſerue &amp; honoure the deuell as though he ſhold ſeem to be the author &amp; maker, therof? It wer better they wold profeſſe them ſelues openly to be maniches and denye that god made the whole man. Yf they had neuer ſo litle taſt of the goſpel thei wold not burſtout in to ſo lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tious impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy. But now it is plain inough, that they in no wiſe know, what is the power and greatnes of this benefite, to be redemed with the bloud of gods ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne.
<pb facs="tcp:18640:10"/> And to proue this true, how can we lok for the reſurrection of the fleſhe excepte we beleue that Chriſte Ieſus is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demer both of bodyes and ſoules?<note place="margin">Corin. i.</note> Saint Paul alſo doth admoniſh vs, not to be the ſeruantes of men, becauſe we were bought &amp; purchaſed with ſo great aprice which is the bloud of gods ſonne. Then he that doth ioyn and addict him ſelfe to the wicked ſeruice of idoles, doth he not treade vnder his feete the moſte ſacred blood of Ieſus Chriſt, wherin doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the price of the eternal and immortal glorie, which we loke for in our bodies? What reaſon is it that our bodies ſhuld be defiled &amp; profaned before idoles, ſeing the crown of eternall lyf is promiſed vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to them in heuen. This wallowinge in ſatans ſtews and moſte filthye defilyng is it a mean and waye wher by we may come to the kingdom of god? Moreouer it was not ſaid without a great cauſe, our bodies ar the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of the holi goſt, therfore they which perceaue not, that they ought to be kept in all holines, doe plainly ſhew them ſelues to perceaue &amp; vnderſtand nothing at all of the goſpel. alſo thei declare that thei know no whit
<pb facs="tcp:18640:10"/> at al what is the power of Ieſus Chriſt and of his grace. For when it is ſaid on this wiſe that we ar bone of his bones and fleſhe of his fleſh he oght to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that we be ioyned with him both in bodye and ſoull. Therefore no man can defile his owne bodye with any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſuperſtition, but he doth ſeparat himſelf, from that coniunction and vnto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherby we ar made the membres of the ſonne of god. But now let theſe wity &amp; ſubtile doctours anſwer me, whethere thei haue receaued baptiſme onli in ther ſouls, or whether god hath commanded rather &amp; inſtituted that this ſigne ſhuld be imprinted in our fleſh. Shal the body then wherein the mark of Ieſus Chriſt is printed, be polluted and defiled with ſo contrary, repugnaunt, and ſo wicked abominations? Alſo the lordes ſupper, is it receaued in the mind only, and not alſo in the handes and mouth? Hath god engrauen in oure bodyes the armes and badges of his ſonne, that we afterward ſhuld pollut our ſelues with al vnclean<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, with moſt foul ſpotes and ſhame, &amp; ſo vnſemely deforme our ſelues that no kinde nor likenes of chriſtian bewtie
<pb facs="tcp:18640:11"/> ſhuld apeare. It is not lawful in coyni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g one pece of gold to printe two contrarie coynes, nether to ſet two ſealles the on repungnaunte to the other, vnto one writing: and ſhal a mortal man take vp on him to countrefete and corrupt bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and the moſte holye ſupper of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and alſo behold to ſay that, ther is no euel in ſo great &amp; miſcheuous a fact? Suche men truly ar worthy, that their ſeruauntes ſhould perſwade. And make them beleue, thei haue a great, pleaſure, to do them ſeruice when not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>withſtanding, they geue them ſelues to ſlepe, pleaſurs and al idlenes, and do not moue one finger to do any worke at all. Yf they ſay it is not alike reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bycauſe we haue nede of their labour that be vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der vs: I anſwer although god haue no nede of vs, yet for that he wil vſe oure labour, ſeruice, and obedience, to ſerue and honour him, truely it is to much vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſemely, and for vs the greateſt ſhame &amp; infamye, to do all thing other wiſe then he will, and cleane to be void of the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye and dutye which we owne vnto him yea our ſhame is ſo muche the greater, that the worme of the earth, and an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuing
<pb facs="tcp:18640:11"/> creature ſhall requiere more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ouer vs, and honour then his crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tour. But yet we muſt talke with theſe beaſtes more plainly. They ſay it is lea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full for them to fein and cloke what ſo, euer they will emong the papiſt, and to conforme them ſelues to that maner &amp; faſhion of religion, whiche is thought moſt apt to noriſh ſuperſtition. Who is he then that geueth them bread to be fed with all ther? Who doth make the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und fertile to bring forth fruit? If god do fede and noriſhe them in thoſe places wher thei dwel as he doth al other men in the other partes of the earth, why do thei not honor the geuer of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> benefite w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> that part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelf, which is ſo bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully noriſhed of him? Why do they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obey and ſerue the deuil with their bodies? If theſe men wer in any part of chriſtians, I wolde vſe with them more waighty and higher reaſons, &amp; I wolde aſke of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to what end we liue in this world, and where vnto our life oghte to be referred. But O miſerable caſe that they which with ſubtelties and ſhiftes wil daily w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god, are ſo brutiſh, that thei muſt be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not only deſtitute
<pb facs="tcp:18640:12"/> of gods ſpirit, but in a maner void of na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tural common ſence. Thei thinke this is a ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t excuſe to ſai, thei do nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in this kind, but for feare of peril &amp; dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but yf this colour maye take place, then muſte we ſaye that Ioſeph ſhulde haue done no euill, yf he had committed whordome wyth hys maiſtres when it was viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly offered him, ſeing he ſhuld not haue folowed hys owne wyll, but haue geuen place to neceſſitie and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which ſhe did vnto him. It ſhulde haue bene a foliſhe facte of him, to enter ſuch peril and infamie, as afterward he ſuffered by the falſe accuſation of that noughty woman, ſeyng he might haue eſcaped thoſe euils yf he had accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed her wil. But we oght rather to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of Ioſeph, and allowe the teſtimony of the holy goſt, who doth commend his conſtancie. If there be no wickednes in taking vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs idoletrous religion when we do it to auoide the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging crueltie of the papiſts, the ſeruant ſhall not ſynne, who for his maiſters pleaſure, ſhal playe the bande, kyll, and play the traitour, for feare to diſpleaſe him, vnder whoſe power he is. But I abide to longe in this matter, wherein
<pb facs="tcp:18640:12"/> (as I ſaid before) there is no dout or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie. It ſhall not be far from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to conſider into how great confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thei fal, which trauail with all their crafts to eſcape gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Others ther be that haue found another ſhifte &amp; ſterting hole, thei grant, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion of the gentils is a wicked &amp; deteſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but it is not al one reaſon of theſe &amp; the ſuperſticions which are in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papiſme. As though all the falſe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that euer was amonge the heithen, was not a corrupting &amp; deprauation of the true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god.

<pb facs="tcp:18640:13"/> repugnant and contrary vnto the ſame. Wherefore let vs kepe this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon rule generally, that al the ordinance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencions of men proponed and take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to corrupt the ſimple truth of gods word, &amp; to peruert that religion whych he requireth &amp; alloweth, ar very ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with which the chriſtian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mai in no wiſe comunicate, without that iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie &amp; contumelye, which treadeth vnder fete gods honor moſt wicked. I knowe wel inough how greuous &amp; intollerable this ſeuere iudgement ſemeth to them, which wold after their own luſt &amp; deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat mind, be more nicelye &amp; mekely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to and taught.

Truly now I percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue how tender &amp; deintie thei ar, I couet ſo much as mai be to ſpare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but both I &amp; thei muſte be condemned ſo ſone as god hath ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: therfore if we wil te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der our own ſaluacion, let vs take it in god part. Thei ſay thei find no man more ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uere &amp; ſharpe then I am, but I wyll de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto them, on the other part, that I handle them more mekely and tender<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye, then the trueth of the cauſe, the

Which thing bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſo in ded, truly they can not excuſe and deliuer them ſelues from the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of that dutie and teſtimonie, that the prophet Ieremie doth requier of the Iewes captiues in Babilon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he not only forbiddeth to come neare the abho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minacions of the Chaldeans, or colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably and feinedly to geue anye conſent to them, but alſo doth geue a plain com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundement that thei ſhuld declare the wicked religion of the Chaldeans to be vnto them a moſt oft filthie ſauor. You ſhal ſay to them (ſaith the prophet Ieremy) the Gods whiche haue not made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth ſhall periſh both out from the earth, and alſo from vnder heauen. There is alſo in this place another cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to be marked, that when the prophet had writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his boke in Hebrue yet he put in this ſentence expreſt in the common vulgar ſpech of the Chaldea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as though he wold by this meanes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the Iewes, to change from their tong, to the end thei might more apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſe the hatred &amp; diſagreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thei haue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wicked idolaters. Now let

Let vs now com to ſhew certaine kinds of idolatries, which ar of moſt eſtimacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in theſe daies. Emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g which ſort y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maſſe is chief, wherof I haue touched ſomthi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before. For although it be ſo famous &amp; notable blaſphemy both in abſurditie &amp; greatnes of miſchief y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gined mor foul &amp; wicked, yet ſtil be thei patro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for an euil cauſe, which do trifle forth in this part. But wil thei nil thei, thei ſhalbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fes this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſay, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maſſe by it ſelf is a deniall of Ieſus chriſts death, &amp; a certain ſacrilege inuented &amp; ordeined by ſata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to aboliſh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrament of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſupper. Nether ar they a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble to deny but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſaints, &amp; ſuffrages for the dead, are wicked abu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes, wherby y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of gods name, a thing of al other moſt holi is profaned &amp; they who amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papiſtes do defile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe abhominations do think the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues gilty of no faute. What ſhuld we do ſai thei? It is not lawful for vs to correct &amp; amend thoſe things, which we
<pb facs="tcp:18640:15"/> know euil &amp; fautie, we are priuate men and thei that haue the power &amp; publike autoritie do erneſtly defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d theſe things Therfore we muſt ſuffer that violent ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſitie. I graunt all this to be true. But I ſaye this is not to the purpoſe. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to their office to correct and appoint a common ordre for the people, nether doth any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> requier this at ther hand, yet neuertheleſſe they ar admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to amed them ſelues, &amp; to inſtitute an honeſt and manerly behauour of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat lyfe, which thing whitout all doubt pertaineth to their duitie. Nether do we commaund them to clenſe the temples and the common ſtreates, but that eueri man kepe his owne bodye and hart in puritie and holynes, and labour by all meanes that god may be honored, ſerued and obeied, in his owne houſe. For theſe are fare vnlyke and much diſſonaunt to aboliſhe the maſſe in any region, and not to be preſent at it, when as the vſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and that religion can by no other mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes be letted but they repete and iterate their ſaing, that is, that thei do not deny the death and paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they haue no ſuche purpoſe, to wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb facs="tcp:18640:16"/> it in their minde. But I do aſke of them, what is that a Chriſten man doth confeſſe with his mouth, but that ſame that he beleueth in hys harte? Thys is plain and, manifeſt inough, that this thing which they do, is moſt diſagreing with the confeſſion of faith. So that, as much as in them lieth, they do not only hyde the true and propre teſtimonye of faith but alſo doe vtterly denye and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it. I will yet talke with them ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more familiarly and plainly. For the Papiſtes doe ſaye the maſſe is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice wherin thei wil offer Ieſus chriſt to reconcile them ſelues to god. But if this be ſo, it foloweth that Ieſus Chriſt hath not optained vnto vs by his death righteouſnes and eternal ſaluation. Let them ſeke al the, compaſes and ſhyftes they will, yet muſt they come here vnto that all whiche go to maſſe, vnder the name of deuotion &amp; religion, do profeſſe that they conſent ther with. Therfor as much truly as in them lieth they ſhewe that they haue not their redemption per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect inogh by the death of Ieſus Chriſt. Ther be many that ſpeake not ſo large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nether ſuffer their talke, to wandre
<pb facs="tcp:18640:16"/> thorowout all ſortes of maſſes, that is to ſaye, ſacrileges. They choſe out one kinde of maſſes only &amp; that thei defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de: it is called the pariſh maſſe, or the high maſſe, for in this thei think ther is more likenes &amp; agreing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſupper of Ieſus Chriſt. And truly it might be ſaid more aptly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al maſſes which ar ſaid both of the prieſts of the loweſt degre, &amp; alſo of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or of thoſe prieſts y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue certen chappels, &amp; all other which are founded by any mans wil or that are ſo ſaleable that thei be ſet forth dayly to ſale, that all theſe I ſay are not vnlike to harlots which in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtewes ſetting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to ſale w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out all ſhame &amp; honeſtie do make their bodies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to al men, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> high maſſ to be veri like y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame harlot which doeth craftely abuſe the honeſt name of an huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to hide her vnſhamefaſtnes, &amp; to reteyn &amp; defend the eſtimacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſt &amp; chaſt wife. Although this ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude doth not agre on euery parte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an harlot ioined in matrimony to an huſband wil haue ſome ſhamfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; modeſtie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe will not ſet forth &amp; make herſelf common to al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> commeth: but the pariſh or high maſſ is an woriſh
<pb facs="tcp:18640:17"/> idolatry of al other moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, ready &amp; ſet forth to al mens deſires and wycked luſtes: although theſe filthye bawdes, do colour and ſmoth here with thys co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and ſuche bewty, that they retaine ſtil ſome relikes of Ieſus Chriſtes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. It is with this as w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the thefe who braggeth and boſteth himſelf then more highly and, gloriouſlye, when he hath wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne and is clothed with the ſpoiles of him whom he hath ſlaine &amp; whoſe horſe he rideth on. We, ſaie they, ſeke the ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per of Ieſus Chriſte, and when we can not being oppreſt vnder that tyrannie, wher in we dwell, haue the ſame pure, we muſt be content with that which is left to vs, loking for the helping hand of God. For ſuch a goodly and pretie ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuſe. By cauſe they haue no, right and perfect vſe, of the ſupper, as though thei had gotten a prouiſon, they witneſſ and openly profeſſ that they haue not Ieſus Chriſte the eternall and only preſte and therfore euerie weke do ſeke a new ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, to put away their ſinnes. For all this is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> high maſſe, as wel as in that which is ſaide in the name of Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las or for the dead. In which thing they
<pb facs="tcp:18640:17"/> fein them ſelues to worſhipe an idole, &amp; yet do boſte that thei ſeke Ieſus Chriſt: and becauſe they wold not ſeme to fight againſt god without ſwerd or buckler, thei bring &amp; obiect the authoritie of this or that man, as though the abſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any one manne may exempt and deliuer them that they be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned of god. I wil not ſaie that thei lye greuouſlye, when thei alege ſuch men as thei do for the defence of their cauſe. But in caſe it wer ſo that a deuout and godly ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wer ſomtime of this minde, that he thought it was nothing euel to come to the high maſſe, yet afterward when he knoweth the truth, yf he doth diſalowe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne his former iudgement, his latter is ſo muche the more to be beleued, for that God hathe brought him, or rather compelled him to diſalowe the ſame, &amp; becauſe he perceueth &amp; plainly knoweth that he is ouercome in that thing which he before did greatlye embrace &amp; alowe. But what nede we herin to ſtirre the truth, as yf we ſhuld bloundre and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a water that is pure and clear. Do they think that with the iudgment and ſainge of a mortall man they maye ſtop
<pb facs="tcp:18640:18"/> god and hedge him in? We knowe that ther is nothing beſides the truth that in iudgment oght to preuaill without the reſpect of any perſon this matter is ſuch that the pariſh or high maſſ is inſtituted to ſacrifice Ieſus Chriſte, &amp; to reconcile the fauour of god both for quick &amp; dead, and alſo that a pece of bred ſhuld be ther worſhipped as though it were the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of god I do not examine thorowli al the abominations and wickednes, that are in that maſſ for they be almoſt innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. But I do reherſe only the worſe &amp; groſſer. Now let them that do but feine a conſent with ſuche wickednes and cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruptions, waſhe their hands ſo clean as they will, yet ſhall they neuer be more iuſt and innocent then Pilate. But this is a meruail that this good &amp; religiouſe pariſhioners at eaſter time do ſeke ſome by chappel, or ſome mockchriſtian mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k, whiche maye prepare and deliuer vnto them the apiſh and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trefet ſupper. Yf the high maſſ is moſt neareſt the ſupper of Ieſus Chriſt, as they ſay it is, why do they not obſerue &amp; kepe it? But how after that they haue, bene at the highe maſſ euery ſonday thorow the year, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:18640:18"/> they wold ſeme to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrament of the ſupper a right, thei ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſhake of and forſake the high maſt But we ſhuld no meruaill at ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they ſaye, for this is a ſure &amp; due puniſhment, for them which haue layd no foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at ani tim of truth in ther mindes, that they ſhuld alwaies wauer and be contraie to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues in al thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs they do and take in hand. As touching that ſame hypocriticall ſupper, I know that they be of this minde, that thei ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe it to be the greateſt iniurys to the ſelues that may be when it is rebuked &amp; improued. But what can we do in that matter ſeinge it is nothinge agreable to Chriſtes rule? Nether do I finde fault with this that they do it ſecretly, for I know that the ſupper was neuer better celebrated, nor more deuoutly, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when the diſciples went into ſome ſecret place to flye the tyrannye of the enmies. But here ar two faults truly not to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. One that they whiche doe make ſuche a ſupper &amp; like apes do falſly and corruptly countrefet the true ſupper of Chriſte, do feine that they kepe and wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhipe their maſſe. The other is that the
<pb facs="tcp:18640:19"/> miniſter, whiche for the moſte parte is ſome religious man the rather to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble the mater, doth not that office as a chriſtian, but as a preſt of the popiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And in this thei ſuppoſe thei haue an honeſt and ſure defence yf the maſſe ſaier haue not this purpoſe to ſhew the bread &amp; wine to them to be worſhipped, if he leaue out the canon wherin ar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined many great impieties, and if he deliuer the ſacrament to all that be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnder both kinds. But when they ſhall come before the higheſt iudge then ſhall they fele the fruit that they ſought by ſuche gloſing and lies, yea truly they oght now already to perceaue it. For I do iudge thoſe ſame goads and prickes wherwith their conſciences ar prikt and wounded to be agreuous fealing of that ſame iudgment. And truely thys cauſe muſt be decided and plainly debated in that ſame place and courte, where the trueth hath her graue &amp; true witneſſes. For to be ſhort, thei the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues do know them ſelues giltye of that mater whieh they haue purpoſed to declare bothe to godes enemies and alſo to the common people. But god muſt neds denye hym
<pb facs="tcp:18640:19"/> ſelfe, yf he allowe the order and doing of that profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If all the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world with one mind and purpoſe wold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpire to pronounce theſe men ryghteous, yet none be he neuer ſo ready and mightye can excuſe and deliuer them from thys but thei ſhalbe thought to halt on both ſides. And god doeth declare by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no ſuch halting of any man ſhal be euer allowed before him. As touchi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the man whom thei choſe to be the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of their ſupper it is a folyſh thing to abuſe his perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as though thei could ſeme to make him an apte man to that office and function. Yea but the vertue of that ſame ſacrament ſay thei, reſteth not in the vertue of the miniſters. That I grant and adde this to alſo, yf any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil ſhuld miniſter the ſupper, it ſhuld be neuer the worſe. On the contrary part if an angell ſhulde ſing maſſe, yet then ſhulde it be no whit the better. But we are nowe in another queſtion, that is, whether orders geuen by the pope to a monk do make him apt to the office and and function do a paſtour. If thei ſay con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary that thei perceiue, that thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g doth mak nothing to the purpoſe, &amp; that thei
<pb facs="tcp:18640:20"/> do not choſe in that ſort the thing it ſelf ſheweth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie. But let it be that thei as touching the miniſter haue no ſuch reſpect. Yet muſte I abide in that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde profeſſion which thei take vpon them &amp; worſhip, yea I muſt preſſe it ear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſtly, as a profeſſion moſte contrary &amp; vnworthye a chriſten man. For this is plain and manifeſt that thei do and will defend and couer themſelues, vnder the perſon of a prieſt made for the nonce to colour and diſſemble. But if thei wolde rightly and lawfully celebrat y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſupper, it were their dutie ſo to ſeperat themſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues from the order and profeſſion of ido<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>latours that thei ſhuld apear in that to haue nothing common with them. But now thei be ſo far from this ſeparation, that thei aſcribe themſelues into theyr felowſhip and communion, &amp; do euerye one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feinedly profeſſe themſelues to be membres of that body. After this thei wil compare vs to the old heretiks, that did refuſe the vſe of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for the vices of the miniſters, as though we do here reſpect the proper ſinnes of euery man &amp; not rather the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſtate &amp; condicion. I do paſſe ouer this matter
<pb facs="tcp:18640:20"/> ſhortly, becauſe that which is ſpoken is ſufficient inough to conuince ſo foule &amp; ſhameful impudencie. But if theſe men be ſo foliſh and dul witted that thei per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue not this filthines, the word of god muſt ſuffice vs, when the lord ſaieth by the prophet Ieremy, Iſrael if thou doeſt turne, turne vnto me. In which words is moſt plainly expreſſed with what ſim<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plicitie &amp; integritie of mind we oght to deale &amp; walke before god, wythout any thought &amp; wil to return to thoſe things which we know are not tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kful nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of him. Which is a cauſe why S. Paul alſo doth teſtifie that he was ſent to turne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnfaithful fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their vanities vnto the liuing god, as though he wold ſay, it is to no purpoſe to change ſome one old &amp; accuſtomed euil w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſes &amp; feinings, but vtterly to aboliſh al ſuperſtitions, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the true religion mai be ſet in her own puritie &amp; holines. For without this faith and integritie, men neuer come the right wai vnto god, but do alwais wauer &amp; ar vncerten to what part thei may tourne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. There be others y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ar come thus far y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and refuſe the maſſe, but thei wold
<pb facs="tcp:18640:21"/> haue ſome patches kept ſtill which they cal gods ſeruice, leaſt as ſome men ſay, thei ſhuld ſeme to be deſtitute of al reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And it may be that ſom of theſe be moued with a godly mind &amp; zeale at the leaſt I will ſo thinke, but what ſoeuer their zeale &amp; purpoſe be, yet may we not ſay that thei kepe, the true rule or anye good meaſure. Many ſay we may come to their baptiſmes, becauſe there is no manifeſt idolatrie in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As who wold ſaye, that this ſacrament were not alſo corrupted, and vtterlye deformed with al kind of corruption, in ſo much as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus chriſt may ſeme to be ſtil in Pilates houſe to ſuffer all opprobries &amp; ſhames. To conclude, whereas thei ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this is the cauſe, why they wolde retaine ſome ceremonies, leaſt thei ſhuld appeare to be voide of al religion, if one ſhulde exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their conſciences, the ſame trulye will anſwere, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei do it to ſatiſfie the papiſts, &amp; thei change their countenance to flie perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Other ſome do watch a time leaſt thei come in the maſſ while and yet thei com to the temple, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhoulde ſuppoſe thei here maſſe. Other ſome com but at euenſong time, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I
<pb facs="tcp:18640:21"/> wold know, whether thei think this to be nothing, that at that ſame the idols be honoured, that the pictures &amp; images be ſenſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fumigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that a ſolemne praier be made in the interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſom ſaint, and grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded on his merites, that <hi>Salue regina</hi> be ſonge with a loude voyce, and that on euery ſide a matter is harde ſo filled and repleniſhed with deuiliſh &amp; curſed blaſphemie that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind ſhall not onely abhorre the offence of the eares &amp; eyes there preſent, but moſt vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thei thought and recordacion therof. I do paſſe ouer that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſinging it ſelfe in an vnknowen tonge is manifeſt profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of gods praiſes &amp; of holy ſcripture as S. Paule doth admoniſh in the .xiiii. to the Corinthes. But let this laſt faut be forgeuen them. If thei come to euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſong to geue ſome ſigne &amp; teſtimonie of their chriſtianitie, thei wil do this chief<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly on the ſolemne feaſtes. But the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there ſhalbe ſolemne enſenſing the chifeſt ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, &amp; great plentie of ſwete fumigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s powred out, the which is a kinde of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice as the ſcripture teacheth. It was alſo a maner vſed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tils, and whereby thei co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weak me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb facs="tcp:18640:22"/> god. And for this cauſe the greateſt part of martyrs did ſuffer death co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, for that they wold not make perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and burne incenſe to idoles.

Yea I doe greatly pitie their miſerable ſtate, whiche ſeke meanes wherby they maye ſerue god de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoutly and liue amonge the enemies of faith if it may be poſſible by any waies. But what wil we? I can do nothing els to the one or to the other, but declare their errour and ſinne, that they them ſelues may adde the remedie. If thei co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e herafter to aſke of me this or that more diligently and particularly, I will ſend ſuch curiouſe inquiſitours to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon rule which haue of god. I ſpeak this for that ther be ſome of this ſort of men ſo importune, that yf a man ſhuld anſwer all their difficulties &amp; doutes, he ſhulde ſeme neuer to mak an end of any thing. And me think ſuch men may wel be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to them who after thei be taught in a ſermon to vſe ſobre apparel and dec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king of the bodye whthout all diſſolute and ſumptuouſe trimming, they wold haue the priacher to make their hooſe &amp; ſewe their ſhoes. Wel what muſt we do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? In this matter there is a certain thing ſet before vs wher vnto we ought to derect and conferre our wholl minde,
<pb facs="tcp:18640:23"/> ſtudie &amp; thought. That is that the zeal of godes houſe mai eat vp our hart and ſo moue vs, that we bear and take vpon our ſelues, al diſhonours, contumelies, and opprobries, which ar done moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily againſt gods holy name. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch deſier of gods honour, and feruent loue ſhall be kindled in our hartes, not like drye ſtubble ſone ſet on fier &amp; eaſely extinguiſhed, but lik a fier that burneth continually, a man ſhallbe ſo far from ſuffering or approuing theſe abomitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wher with the name of god moſte ſham<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fully &amp; vnwortheli is polluted, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhall beholde them, he ſhalbe able in in no wiſe to ſuffer diſſimulation, ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and taciturnitie. And it is diligently to be marked, that he ſaith, the zeal of gods houſe, that we ſhuld know that to be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferred, vnto the outward order which is inſtituted in the churche, that we ſhuld exerciſe our ſelues in confeſſion of oure faith. I do not wey the mockers whych ſay, that I my ſelfe lyuing here without ane daunger, yea rather in great quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, doe talke goodlely of this maters. I am not he with whom theſe men haue any thing to do. For this is wel knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:18640:24"/> I haue here no land of myn owne. So mai we thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k &amp; ſai of al theſe philſophers whiche geue their Iudgment without knowlege of the cauſe.

I ſpeake thys by cauſa coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilours, Iudges, proctours, aduocats, and ſuche othere bearinge the ſwing in courtes and iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ar not only bold to ſtriue with GOD, and ſo to contend

<pb facs="tcp:18640:25"/> Now although the courtears are wont to gratifie men with the ſprinkling of their holye water, let them not thinke that thei can with that kind of doing ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſfie god. To conclude, al ieſters &amp; pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hold their to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge &amp; boſt not out their merie wittie ſayinges, onles they wil fele his mightie ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, at whoſe word thei ought to tremble. Wherein theyr errour is to much foliſhe that beleueth becauſe thei take me for their aduerſary therefore thei ſhall not haue god to be their iudge. Let them ſcrape my name out of their bokes and vtterlye bloth it forth, ſpecially in this kind of cauſe and queſtion, wherein my purpoſe is onely that god be hard and obeyed, not that I ſhulde rule mens conſciences after my luſt, &amp; charge them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any neceſſitie or lawe. As for all others which do not ſo proudly diſpiſe gods word, and yet ar ſo delicate and weake that thei can in no wiſe be moued, I do moſt hartily beſech them, that thei wil take more thoughte and regard to their own duty, ſaluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and gods honour, &amp; do no more flatter themſelues, as thei haue done hitherto. Let them therfore open their eies, and
<pb facs="tcp:18640:25"/> reare vp them ſelues that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the miſerie wherein thei are.</p>
            <p>I know well inough the euils, difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſtoppes wherin thei be wrapt emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the papiſts, I do not ſpeake vnto them, as though it were an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the middeſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> idolatries to take vpon them to defend the pure and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere religion of god, but if thei lack ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gth, I aduertiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to flie vnto god the autour of all power, that thei may be made ſtrong by him &amp; learn to prefarre his glory before al things of this world. For I do earneſtly deſier that all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men which are miſerably afflicted in the papiſme, ſhould vnderſtand &amp; know this, howe that the prophet Ieremy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining at Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Iewry did ſend this aduertiſement and exhortacion vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the people which were holden cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and oppreſſed in Babilon. Yf the tiranny of the pope and of all his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres be to them ſharpe and cruell, thei muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, that the Iewes alſo of that time ſuffered heauy and bitter bondage and yet thei are commaunded in the vul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gare ſpeach of the countrey to execrate the idolatrie of the Chaldea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. It is not
<pb facs="tcp:18640:26"/> reaſon that the tiranny of men ſhoulde break or any deal diminiſh from vs that due honour we ow vnto god. Here is no exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or pretence of preuelege, which high or low riche or poore may or ought to vſurpe vnto them ſelues. Let al men therefore bow downe their neck, &amp; with moſte humilitie ſubmit them ſelues to god. Let the poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue the true fear of god, let him not ſay vnconſtantly I know not what to do, leaſt god anſwer him, nether know I what to do w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thee. The riche and wealthy men let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not like drunken ſloggards ſlepe in their wealth, and conſume in their proſperity and abundance of al thynges, as it wer in a certain draftubbe, but rather after the example of S.

Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly we ought to be ſo min<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded, that being aſſured of the right and goodnes of the cauſe, we ſhoulde be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with this due deſier to folowe god whither ſo euer he ſhal cal vs, to em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brace his word with ſuche reuerence as it is worthy, and being called backe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the deceitfull faſhion of this worlde, as men rauiſhed, with their whole minde and endeuour ſhould be caried to an hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenly lyfe. But O moſt miſerable caſe, that when the lighte of god doth ſhine vnto vs in theſe daies ſo bright as it did neuer ſhine in the remembrace of men, yet ſo litle zeale fauour and loue ſhould be founde. Wherein our miſerie is ſo
<pb facs="tcp:18640:29"/> much the greater, that in ſo great filthi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes &amp; vnthankfulnes we are not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with bluſhing ſhame. For we muſt ſhortly come before that iudge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom our vice and euell which we by all meanes go about to hide, ſhalbe brought forth, with that rebuke &amp; check wherby the iuſt cauſe of our deſtruction ſhal appeare. For if we be ſo endetted &amp; bounde to god, that for the knowledge he hath geuen vs, we ought to geue to him honourable and thankfull teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, why is our ſtomak ſo abaſhed &amp; fear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful to entre into the battell? Eſpecially ſeing god in this our age, hath ſo ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelf, that it may be rightly ſayd and truly, that he hath opened &amp; plainly ſet furth, the greateſt treaſures of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cretes. May not this be ſaid, that we ſo think of god, as thogh we ſemed to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d no nede of him at all? For if we had any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his maieſtie, we durſt neuer be ſo bold to turn y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine which procedeth out of his mouthe into philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie and vain ſpeculation. In fine we can haue no excuſe, but this muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to vs the greateſt ſhame, yea an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that in ſo great know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb facs="tcp:18640:30"/> obtained by the ſingular goodnes of god we haue ſo litle loue &amp; minde to defend &amp; kepe the ſame. For firſt, yf we wil call to our reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance the martyrs of old time, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare their wonderful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtancie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this our tender ſlouthfulnes, we ſhall finde paſſing great cauſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt our own filthines. For thei wer not for the moſt part ſo trauailed &amp; exerciſed in the ſcriptures, that thei could lerned<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly deſpute of al matters. But firſt of al, thei knew &amp; held faſt this, that there is one god, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei oght to ſerue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: then, that thei were redemed with the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, that in him only &amp; in his grace thei ſhulde put their affiaunce, and truſt of ſaluacion. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they did iudge all other inuencions and ordinances of men, to worſhip god, ſo vnworthy filthines, that thei coulde eaſly condemne al idolatries &amp; ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude in few words this was their deuinitie, ther is one only god the maker of the whole world, which hath declared vnto vs his wil by Moſes &amp; the prophets, &amp; then by Ieſus Chriſt &amp; hys apoſtles. We haue one redemer, wyth whoſe blood we wer bought, &amp; by whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:18640:30"/> grace we hope to be ſaued. Al the idoles of the worlde, are to be deteſted &amp; accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Thei came ſtoutly and boldly to the fier, or other kinde of death, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, inſtructed with no other doctrine and more hidden knowledge. And the numbre of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was not ſmal, as of two or thre, but ſo great that the multitude of thee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which were cruelly vexed &amp; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented of the tyrants ſemed innumera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble and infinite. But we are ſo taught &amp; inſtructed, that we paſſe all our aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours in knowledge &amp; vnderſtanding of holy ſcripture. We thinke in our ſelues and it is true, as touching the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture, god hath endued vs w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo much knowledge, as he hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to any age at any time. And yet there is in vs ſcantly the leaſt droppe of feruent loue towards god. Ther is no reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whi we ſhulde noriſh this nice cowardnes of minde, onleſſe we wold willingly &amp; wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tingly prouoke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath &amp; vengeance of god, againſt our ſelues. What muſt we then? Truly we muſt take to vs a ſtout, bold, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mind. We muſt chefly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how precious &amp; honorable y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; teſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our faith is befor god
<pb facs="tcp:18640:31"/> For we do litle know, howe god doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion, when our life whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch is of no value, is more ſet by &amp; deare vnto vs. Wherein our wonderfull and beaſtly foliſhnes is ſhewed: for we can not in this ſort ſpare our life, but we muſt nedes confeſſe that we ſet more thereby, then by gods honour and our owne ſaluacion. A certain heathen man could vſe this ſaying, that it is a miſera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble thing, to forſake &amp; betray the cauſes why we life for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conſeruacion of life. Yet he and his like did neuer know tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to what end me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wer ſet in the world, and wherefore thei lyued therein. Thei might wel ſay, that vertue is to be eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and folowed, &amp; that we oght to liue an honeſt life without blame. But all their vertues were nothing els but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and ſhadowes. But we haue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderſtanding, whereunto our life muſt be referred, which is, that we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour god, with al praiſe and glory, that he himſelf may be our glory. Without him, our life is miſerable, the which we can not continue the leaſt moment, but we ſhall heape vpon our ſelues, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall malediction. And yet we ar no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:18640:31"/> aſhamed for the winning of a few dayes, for this feble life, to refuſe the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal kingdom, &amp; to ſeperat our ſelues from him, by whoſe power we are conti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nued in this life. Yf a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhuld examine the moſt vnlerned, yea thoſe whoſe wit is ſo daſed, and whoſe life is ſo volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, that they be moſt like to brute beaſts, what maner of life is appointed them, they durſt not ſay plainly &amp; open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it ſhould conſiſt only in eating, drinking, and ſleping. For thei knowe that they are created to a better, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier and more higher thyng: which is nothing els, but to ſerue and honour god with al kinde of honour, &amp; to ſuffer our ſelues as good children to be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ruled by our moſt benigne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that after the end of thys frail and vnſure life, we may be receiued into his eternall heretage. In the appointyng &amp; winning of this end, conſiſteth the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and greateſt point of our felicitie, yea all the whole weight of euerlaſting life. But when we cary our mindes and thoughts another wai, &amp; do ſnatche faſt hold of this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t life worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand deathes, what excuſe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue?
<pb facs="tcp:18640:32"/> For, to lyue and be ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cauſes wherfore we lyue, is vnnatural. But to forſake the cauſes wherfore we liue here for the deſier and loue to prolo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g our life as it wer for thre daies in this deceatful world, and to be ſeparated from god the author of lyfe, is ſuche a bewitching and furiouſe madnes, that I know not with what wordes we oght to expreſſe and ſhew it. But what ſo euer knowlege we haue, and how ſo euer our lyfe is apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for ſo muche as not with ſtandyng the perſecutions are no leſſe and bitter, let vs conſider how and by what means the Chriſtian men may confirme them ſelues in patience, and ſo ſtrenghthen their mindes, that they may conſtantly venter to daunger their lyfe for goddes trueth. This ſame text whiche we haue recited, being well vnderſtanded maye bring vs to that indifferencye of minde, yea to that willingnes, that we ſhall not refuce to ſuffer death for Goddes name. Let vs go forthe of the cytie, ſaith the apoſtle, after the lord Chriſte, beri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his opprobrie, firſt he doth teach &amp; admoniſh vs, that although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſwerds ar not alreadi drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to kil vs, or the fiers
<pb facs="tcp:18640:32"/> kindled to broile &amp; burne vs, yet that we can not truly be ioyned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſonne of god, ſo long as we haue the roots of our thoughtes &amp; deſiers fixed in this world. Wherefore the Chriſten man muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wais, although he be in quiet, haue one fote lifted vp to the battel, and not only that, but alſo his minde muſt be vtterly ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world although his bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy be therein. Although this at the fyrſt fight may ſeme vnreſonable, yet one ſai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of S. Paul, oght to be ſufficient to perſuade vs, for that we be called &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to this, to ſuffer perſecution. As though he ſhuld ſay, ſuch is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion of our chriſtianitie, that we muſt nedes enter in &amp; paſſe thorow thys way yf we will folow Chriſt. In the meane ſeaſon, to eaſe our infirmitie &amp; to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the tediouſnes &amp; heauines, which perſecutions bryngeth, we haue thys great and ſwete comfort, that we ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all theſe inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, opprobries and dangers of life for the goſpell, do as it were ſet our fete in euery foteſtep of gods ſon, &amp; do folow him as our prince and guide. If it had bene onely ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that we muſt paſſe through al the
<pb facs="tcp:18640:33"/> opprobries of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world to kepe the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an profeſſion, and alſo ſuffer death frely and without fear when ſoeuer gods will were, methink we ſhuld haue had ſome colour to anſwer and ſay contrarie, that it is a thing diuers and abhorring from our nature to wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ſo without a giude But ſeing weare charged &amp; commanded to folow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord Ieſus, his leading ought to ſeme ſo right and honorable, that we haue no iuſt excuſe to refrain or refuſe his commandement. But that we ſhuld haue more earneſt loue &amp; deſier towards this lawdable and helthfull example, it was not only ſayd that Ieſus Chriſte doth lead the way as a guide and prince but alſo that we are made like vnto hys image. For ſo. S. Paul in the epiſtle to the Rom. ſpeaketh, that god hath choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and called al them whom he hath taken in to the numbre of his children, that they ſhuld be like faſhioned after the Image of hym which is apointed the patterne and heade ouer all. What, are we ſo nice and tender that we can or will bear and ſuffer nothynge at all? Then muſt we nedes refuſe gods grace wherby he caleth vs to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hope of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:18640:33"/> and leadeth vs ther to by this way? For theſe two are ſo ioyned to gether y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the one can not be ſeparated from the other, that we be the members of Ieſus Chriſte, and that by means of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction and communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we be exerciſed with many afflictions and calamities. This ſame maner of our lyfe ſo ioyned with gods ſonne, and ſuche conformitie to him, we oght to eſteme more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we do, and alſo to Iudge it not only by all wayes moſt worthye to be profeſſed but alſo to be folowed. The ſuffering of cala<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mities for the goſpell, in the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Iudgment of the world, is the greateſt infamie but ſeing we know that all the vnfaithfull ar ſo blinded, that they can ſee or rightli iudge nothing at al, ought not we to haue clear eies, &amp; to iudge more perfectly? It is ſhame to be afflicted and vexed of them that occupie the ſeat of, iuſtice. But S. Paul doth ſhew vs by his example, that we haue great occaſion to glory in the ſcarres of Ieſus Chriſt, and as it wer in certain markes imprinted in vs, wher with we being marked and deckt, god doth acknowleg and receaue vs for his ſeruaunts and elect. And we
<pb facs="tcp:18640:34"/> know this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> S. Luke doth rehearſe of Peter &amp; Iohn, that they were very glad and ioyful, that they were thought wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy to ſuffer for the lorde Ieſus name, ſclander rebukes and ſhame. Where in two thinges maye be ſene contrarie in them ſelues, ſhame, and honor, by thys that the world running hedlong in fury and madnes, doth iudge againſt all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, &amp; by this meanes doth change the glory of god with diſhonour &amp; infamie. Let not vs now diſdain ſo to be diſpiſed and to be rebuked of the world, that we may hereafter obtain w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god and his an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gels, honor, glory &amp; praiſe. We ſe what gteat labors ambitious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taketh to ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain the order of ſome king, &amp; after thei haue atcheued it, what triumphes they make: but the ſonne of god doth offer to vs his order, &amp; yet eueri one deſpiſeth it &amp; is tourned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the whole power of the minde to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vanitie of the world. I pray you when we behaue our ſelues proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfully, ar we worthy to haue any thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him? Although our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding can perceiue &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend nothing herein, yet of a truth theſe are the proper &amp; honorable badges &amp; armes
<pb facs="tcp:18640:34"/> of heuenly nobilitie. Impriſonmentes, baniſhments, maledictions, after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of men bring nothing elles then great ſhame &amp; infamie. But what doth let vs to ſee what god doth iudge &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce of theſe things, ſauing our own infidelity? Wherefore we muſt labour y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the name of gods ſonne be of ſuch autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie, waight, &amp; honor with vs, as it is moſt worthy, that we think we are wel and honorably delt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>al, that his burnes as it were certain badges are printed in vs, or els our vnthankfulnes can in no wiſe be borne. If god ſhuld perſecute vs after our merites, hath he not iuſt cauſe euery day to chaſtiſe and puniſhe vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wayes. Yea ſurely no deathes put vnto vs were able to recompence y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt part of our miſchief. But of this great &amp; infinite goodnes, he treadeth vnder fote al our ſinnes, &amp; doth vtterly aboliſhe the ſame, and whereas he might puniſhe vs according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatnes of our ſinnes he hath inuented another merueilous way wherby the afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are traduced from our deſerued payne and puniſhment, to a great honour and a certaine priuilege and ſinguler benefite, becauſe that by
<pb facs="tcp:18640:35"/> the partaking and ſuffering of them we are receaued into the felowſhip of gods ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. May it be other waies ſaid or iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, then that we, ſeing we deſpiſe and diſdain this ſo excellent and bliſfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and maner of liuyng, haue lytle profetted in the chriſtian doctrin? This is the cauſe why S. Peter after he had moued vs to lyue a godly &amp; holy lyfe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fear of god, farr from that lyfe wherfore other men as theues, whormongers, adulterours, and menkillers ſuffer, by and by addeth this, yf we muſte ſuffer as chriſten men, there in we geue glory to god for that great and ſinguler bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, which he hath beſtowed on vs. Nor it is not for nothing that the holy man ſpeaketh thus, what are we, I pray you that we ſhuld be witneſſes of gods truth &amp; as it were proctours apointed to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his cauſe. Behold we be miſerable men as it were wormes of the earth creaturs full of vanities &amp; lies, yet god will haue his truth defended by vs, which is truly ſo great honor, that it ſemeth not to per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> angells i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This one reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel conſidered, oght it not to enflame &amp; ſtire vp our mindes, to offer oure ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:18640:35"/> wholy to god, &amp; to ſhew our wholl ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoire in ſo holy and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a matter to pleaſe him? And yet many ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not forbear but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei wil ſpeak againſt god or at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt thei wil complaine, that he hath no greater regard to eaſe their imbecillitie. it is a merueilous mater, ſai thei, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g god hath borne vs thus much fauour, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs to be his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet he wil ſuffer vs to be ſo cruelly vexed &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed of wicked men. I do yet anſwer theſe men, that although we know no reaſon why god doth ſo deal with vs, yet his authoritie ſhuld be ſuch w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhuld applye, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme our ſelues to his wil but now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſe Ieſus chriſt to be ſet for an example to vs leaſt we ſhould ſeke any other, oght we not to thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k our ſelues greatly happye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we be ſo drawen after his image and liknes? Morouer God doeth ſet forth and ſhewe playne and manifeſt cauſes, wherefore he will haue vs to ſuffer perſecution, emonge which, yf there were non other but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reaſon and aduertiſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which. S. Peter geueth we muſt nedes be very pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiſh &amp; ſturdy, onles we be ſatiſfied therw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> This is his reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſeing gold &amp; ſiluer

He could by and by after our calling, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conflict &amp; ſufferyng of theſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties haue crowned vs. But as he wolde haue Chriſt to raigne in the middeſt of his enemies, euen ſo he wolde haue vs alſo dwelling amonge the ſelfe ſame, to bear &amp; ſuffer their violence &amp; oppreſſion vntil we be deliuered from theſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; calamities by him. And I am not ignorant, that the fleſh wil then great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpurne and refuſe to be ruled, when it muſt be brought into this ſtate, but yet the will of god muſt rule al our thoghts and luſtes. Yf we fele in our ſelues ſom contradiction &amp; reſiſtance it is not great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to be merueyled at. For that is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; engrauen in our nature to flye the croſſe. Yet let vs abide ſtill, in that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes of the fleſhe, but let vs go on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, knowing that our obedience is thankful &amp; acceptable to god, ſo that we caſt down our ſenſes &amp; appetites, &amp; d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

They ſhal lead the whether thou would not, ſayde our lord Ieſus to Peter. So when ſuch fear of death doth pricke our mindes let vs labour by all meanes, that we maye haue the ouerhande, or rather that god mai ouercome, &amp; in the meane while let vs thus perſuade our ſelues, that it is to him a moſt pleaſaunt ſacrifice when we reſiſt our appetites, &amp; do ſo withſtande the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that by this meanes being ſubdued vnder his power, we may order &amp; leade our life after his wil &amp; pleaſure.

<pb facs="tcp:18640:37"/> In olde time the numbre was almoſt in finite of them, which for the deſier of a garland made of corruptible leaues, did refuſe no laboure, paine and wraſtlinge and alſo did ſo ſuffer death it ſelfe, that thei might ſeme to haue their lyfe in no price.

What is the cauſe, that we ar ſo faynt herted in the largenes and worthines of this honour, which is certaine &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal? Do we think that this was ſpoken in vaine, that we ſhal lyue with Chriſt, yf we be dead with hym? The triumph is prepared for vs, but we ſo much as we may do flye from the conflycte and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. But thys doctrine is ſuche, that it ſemeth plainlye to diſagre with mans Iudgement. Thys is true.</p>
            <p>Nether alſo Chriſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he pronounceth
<pb facs="tcp:18640:37"/> them bleſſed which ſuffer perſecution for righteouſnes ſake, doeth propound ſuch a ſentence as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde wold allow or receyue. Yea he wil haue vs to thinke that the chefeſt felicitie, which we iudge the greateſt miſerie. We thinke our ſelues moſt miſerable, when god doth ſuffer vs to be afflicted and oppreſſed with the tyrany and cruel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of our enemies. But we do wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully erre in this, that we ſet not before our eies gods promiſes, which do plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly confirme vnto vs, that al things ſhal come to our perfect, ioy, and ſaluacion. We caſt down our ſtomackes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire when we ſee wicked and noughty men to haue the ouer ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on vs, &amp; to do that crueltie to vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei ſeme to treade down our necke w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their feet. But thys ſame moſt cruel vexation of the wicked &amp; ſo great trouble &amp; confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of things, as S. Paul warneth, oght rather to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firme our mindes raiſe vp &amp; lift the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into heauen. For becauſe of our own nature we ar bent to the ſtudy &amp; loue of things preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; ar ſo i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flamed that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our whole knowledge, minde &amp; cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we ar oc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cupied in to much loui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; vſing this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:
<pb facs="tcp:18640:38"/> god, when he ſuffreth vs to be thus eue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> vexed and handled, &amp; the wicked to grow and floriſh in al things, doth teache and admoniſh vs by theſe plaine and notable ſings of his moſt iuſt Iudgement, that, that daie ſhal once come, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all things that be now troubled &amp; confuſed, ſhalbe ſattled. But yf that ſame time ſeme far &amp; long to, let vs flye to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reamedie, &amp; let vs not flatter our ſelues in our vice. For this is certaine that we haue no faith at al onleſſ we caſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eies of our minde to the honourable coming of Ieſus Chriſt. And becauſe god wold leaue out no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that might be apt to moue &amp; ſtirre vs, he doth ſet forthe one that one part promiſes, on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other part threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenings. Do we fele that the promiſes of god haue not force Inough and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie in vs? To confirme them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al let vs Ioin ther to the threatenings. We ſhew our ſelues wondrouſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſence we beleue goddes promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes no more then we doe. When the lorde Ieſus Chriſte. ſaith, he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege vs for his owne and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe ſo of vs before his father, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ him before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what ſhuld let vs to

How precious then ſhal the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly life be vnto vs when it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pared w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this preſent life which is loſt? It is not my purpoſe in this place to col<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lect al the promiſes ſet forth in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture to this end. Yet ſence thei be repea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted ſo often times renued vnto vs, we oght ſo to be experienſed not only in the reading, but alſo in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>latio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we might be as it wer died &amp; ſurely confirmed in them. But yf when the plage hangeth ouer our heads thre or four of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firme &amp; ſtrengthen vs, truly an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth ſhuld be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al aduerſete &amp; contrary tentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But if with theſe great ſwete promiſes can not entice &amp; draw vs to him, are we not very great dullerds, &amp; betle heads, when nether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeuer threatenings can work any more in vs? Ieſus Chriſt doth apoint a dai to accuſe al the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before his father which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the truth for feare of loſing this life, for whom he declareth deſtruction both of body and ſoule to be prepared.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:18640:39"/>
            <p>Alſo in another place he proteſteth that he wyll refuſe all maner of communion with them that denie him before men, Theſe words onleſſe we be vtterly void of all ſence ought vehemently to moue our mindes &amp; ſo to fray vs, that for fear the heares of our head ſhoulde ſtert vp. But how ſo euer it be, onleſſe we be ſo affected &amp; moued as the greatnes of the matter and danger requireth, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth nothing els for vs, but to loke for horrible and moſt miſerable confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: wherein we may excuſe our faute ſo muche as we luſt, &amp; we may ſay that in this great frailtie and weakenes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we rather are worthy of mercy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any ſeueritie &amp; ſharpenes of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it wil not ſerue. For it is written on the contrary parte, that Moſes after he had ſene god by fayth was ſo harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſtrengthened, that no violence of temptacion coulde melt his minde, &amp; bende him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great conſtancie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore when we be ſo tender and flexible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there apear in vs no power of firme and conſtant minde, we ſignifie and declare plainely that we be vtterly ignorant of god and his kingdom. Alſo when we ar
<pb facs="tcp:18640:39"/> warned that we ought to be ioined and coupled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our head, we haue gotten a goodly colour to exempt &amp; ſeperate our ſelues from him, if we ſay we are men. And were not they that were before vs men ſo wel as we are? Yea if we had no thing els, but euen the bare doctrine of godlines, yet were al the excuſes which we can bring weake &amp; of no value. But now are worthy more greater checke &amp; condemnation, ſence we haue ſo great &amp; notable examples, whoſe great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie oght veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to excite &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme our mindes. There are two chefe parts of this our exhortacion or conſolation to be conſidered. The firſt is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this hath bene a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſtate to the vniuerſall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church alwaies &amp; euer ſhalbe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of the world, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was vexed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch iniuries and contumelies of the wicked as it is reported in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pſalm. cxxix. Thei haue vexed me euen nowe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my youth hither to, &amp; haue drawen a plough ouer and ouer euery part of my backe. The holy goſt in this place doth bring in the old church ſpeaking on this wiſe that it ſhuld not ſeme now vnto vs a new thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g nor greuous, if we ſe in theſe dayes our
<pb facs="tcp:18640:40"/> cauſe &amp; condition to be like. S. Paul alſo reciting the ſame place of an other Pſal. wher it is ſaid. We wer as it wer ſhepe led to the ſlaughter, doth declare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this pertai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ed not only to one age, but it was &amp; ſhalbe the common, vſuall &amp; continual ſtate of Chriſts church. So that if we ſee in this time the church to be ſo handled &amp; vexed, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inſolencie and pride of the wicked, that ſome bark at her, ſome bite her, many afflict her, &amp; alwaies inuent ſome miſchef &amp; peſtilent deſtruction to her, yea &amp; ſet vpon her without ceaſi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as it were mad dogges &amp; wilde raueni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g beaſtes, let vs cal to remembreunce that ſhe was ſo vexed afflicted and oppreſſed in al times before. God doth geue vnto her ſomtime, ſome reſt &amp; refreſhing &amp; as it were atime of truce. And this is that which is ſpoken in the pſal oboue alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the righteous lord doth cut in ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der the cordes of the wicked: and in an other place, that he breaketh their rodde, leſt the good being to much preſſed ſhuld and moue their handes: to inniquitie. But god wold alwaies haue his church to be toſt in thys world, and as it were alwayes in a certaine conflict reſerui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
<pb facs="tcp:18640:40"/> for her quiet reſt in heauen. The end of theſe afflictions was alwaies bleſſed, yea truly god wrought this y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the church alwaies preſſed with mani and great di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fficult calaminites, was neuer vtterly oppreſſed. As it is ſaide in an other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, the wicked with all their labour did neuer optain that they deſiered. S. Paul alſo doth ſo glorye of like happye end and iſſue of afflictions, that he ſheweth this grace of god to be perpetuall in his church. We ſaith he, are preſt with all kind of afflictions, but we are not killed with ſorow and care, we liue in great nede &amp; pouertie, yet are we not forſaken we are caſt down but periſh not, alwais carrieng about the mortificatione of our lord Ieſus Chriſt, that his life alſo may be declared in our mortal bodye. This iſſue and end, as we ſee that god hath alwaies made, it happye &amp; proſperouſe in the perſecutions of the church, oght to bolden vs, ſeing we knowe that our fathers, who alſo acknowleged their frailty and weaknes, had alwaies thee victorie ouer their enemies, be cauſe they continued, conſtaunt In paciencye.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:18640:41"/>
            <p>I do entreat this firſt part of my exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion briefly, that I maye come the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the ſecond, which doth more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the purſpoſe. And that is, that we applie certaine examples of the mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyres which were before vs, to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolacion &amp; comfort. And in this kinde or numbre there be not two or three, but a great &amp; thicke cloude as the apoſtle wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrues .xii. Whereby he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, that ther is ſo great a multitude of them, which haue ſuffered for the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of the truth, that ſo wel the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of excellent examples, as the moſt graue authority ought to prouoke vs to contentacion, pacience, and mode<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration of minde. And leaſt my oration ſhold waxe to long in heaping vp toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an infinite multude of examples, I wil only ſpeake of the Iewes, which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fered moſt greuous perſecution for the true religion, both vnder the tiranny of king Antiochus, &amp; alſo ſhortly after his death. We can not ſay that the numbre of the afflicted men was ſmal, when a great mighty armye as it were of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs was prepared to maintain &amp; defend the religion. Nether can we alledge
<pb facs="tcp:18640:41"/> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were certaine excellent prophets who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god had choſen forth and ſeparated frome the comon ſort of people, for there were women, boyes, and infantes, alſo in that number of martyrs. Nether will we ſay that thei paſſed thorow that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, only with ſome light loſſe, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great peril of lyfe, without great paines and torments of bodies, ſeing, ther was no kinde of cruelty vpproued in afflicting, vexing, &amp; torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting them. Let vs here alſo what the apoſtle doth ſaye of them, and doth ſet forth for vs to folow. Some faith he, were hanged vp like belles and ſtretched, diſpiſing to be deliuered that they might optaine a bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter reſurrection: other were proued with opprobrious wordes and ſtrippes, or w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bondes &amp; priſonment: other were ſtoned or cutt inſonder, or killed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſwerd: other ſome went wandering hether and thether thorowe hilles and caues of the earth. Let vs now come to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon betwixt them and vs. Yf they ſuffred ſo many and great tormentes for the truth, which was as then but obſcure, what oght we to doe in this great light, which hath ſhined vnto vs in
<pb facs="tcp:18640:42"/> this time? God ſpeaketh vnto vs nowe as with full mouth. The greateſt gate of the kingdom of heauen is made open vnto vs. Ieſus Chriſt comen from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto vs doth ſo call vs to him, that we haue him preſent as it were before our eies. In to how great ingratitude &amp; ſhameful wickednes ſhal we runne into if we haue leſſe ſtomake &amp; loue to beare and ſuffer for the goſpell, then thei had which dyd beholde the promiſes of god but as it were a farre of, who had but a very lytle dore opened to inter into the kingdom of god, who had receaued only a remembrance and obſcure teſtimonie in figures of Ieſus Chriſt? Theſe great matters can not be declared and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with any wordes as thei be worthy. Wherefore I leaue them to be weied in euery mans thoughts and meditacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. This doctrine as it hath a common and vniuerſall reaſon, ſo it muſt be referred to the exerciſe &amp; order of euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s life. But euery man muſt apply it to his pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pre vſe &amp; profit apt for his owne conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And I ſpeake this for this cauſe leaſt that they which ſee them ſelues to be in no manifeſt peryll, ſhould ſuppoſe
<pb facs="tcp:18640:42"/> this doctrine to be vaine and not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to them. Nowe they are no in the hands of tirantes, but what know they how god wil deale with them herafter. Therfore we muſt be of that minde and iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that if any perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which we loked not for happen vnto vs, that we fall not therein to vnwares and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouided, but that we come to it prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red long before hand. But I feare there be many deaph eares to whom this my oration is made without fruit. For thei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that liue in quiet hauing all thinges at wil, are ſo far from preparing them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to take and ſuffer death when nede ſhalbe, that thei haue no care nor thoght of ſeruing god at all. But this ought to be al our ſtudy continually, eſpecially in theſe great trobleſom times, wherin we liue in great peryll. In the meane time thei whome god calleth to ſuffer for the teſtimonye of hys name, muſt thinke in very dede that thei were prepared long be fore, and broughte to this ſufferance of euils, by the mocion &amp; certain iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſpirit, that they might bear them ſelues therin boldly and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Then alſo they muſt diligently call
<pb facs="tcp:18640:43"/> to the remembrance al the exhortations which they haue herd before, and be ſo ſtirred with the aduertiſment of them, as the valiaunt ſouldiare to take his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour when he hereth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trumpet blowe. But what ſeke we? Truly in theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils we do nothing ells: but ſeke ſhiftes &amp; waies how to eſcape. I meane this by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part of men. For this ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution is as it were a touche ſtone, wherwith god doth trye and proue who be his: but ther are fewe found of that faith, cowrage and godlines towardes god, that they will offer them ſelues frankely and freely vnto death for his names ſake. This is a thing almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, that they which do glory, that they haue ſome knowlege in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, are ſo impudent and vnſhamfaſt, they wil vſe ſuch cauillatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Some wil ſay, what ſhal it auail to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſ our faith before thoſe ſtubborne ſtifnecked men, whiche are purpoſed to warre agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt god himſelfe? Is not this to caſt pearles be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore ſwine? As who wolde ſay, Ieſus Chriſt doth not moſt plainly declare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he doth requier of vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his name yea amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g moſt perverſe &amp; wicked men?
<pb facs="tcp:18640:43"/> But if this our teſtimony do nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fit to their edifiing, yet ſhall it profit to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Alwaies y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of our faith doth ſauour ſwetly before god al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge death and deſtruction to wicked men. There be other alſo which will ſay this, what ſhall our death pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite when it ſhall ſeme to geue more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence then vtilitie? As though god hath left to them ſelues fre choyſe to dye whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they will or when they ſhall think it the moſt apte time of death? But we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie wiſe do obei him but as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruit that muſt come by our death, we leaue to the hand &amp; prouidence of god. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the chriſtian man muſt moſt chifly in what place ſo euer he be, diligently ſe that he lyue in that ſimplicitie and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie that god requireth, and that he be not brought from that mind &amp; maner of godly and holy life at any time with any daungers or threatninges. Let him eſchue ſo muche as is poſſible the ragi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g madnes of the wolues, ſo that the ſame warenes be not ioyned with the prudence and craftines of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Fyrſt of al let him do this, that he geue ouer and reſigne his lyfe into the hands
<pb facs="tcp:18640:44"/> of god the moſt faithfull keper. When he hath ordeined and kept diligentlye this maner and faſhion of lyfe, yf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he fal in to the handes of enemies let him thinke and perſuade himſelfe, that he is brought into that place of god, for this cauſe that he mai haue him a witnes of hys ſonne. Therefore ſeing he is called and brought to that confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on by the certain decree of god, there is no way to go backe, onles he wil be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull vnto him, to whome we haue promiſed all our endeuours both to liue and dye: yea whoſe we are although we had promiſed nothing at all. I meane not hereby to driue euery man of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie at all time to geue a full and perfect confeſſion of their faith, no not ſome ti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes when thei be aſked. For I knowe-what meaſure and moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. Paule vſed, who was as ready with heart and minde to defende the goſpell as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Neither was this ſpoken by the Lorde Ieſus and promiſed without a cauſe, that god woulde geue vs in that tyme and matter, a mouth and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. As though he would haue ſayde, the office of the holy ghoſt, is not onely
<pb facs="tcp:18640:44"/> to confirme vs, that we may be willing bolde and ſtronge, but alſo it conſiſteth in geuing vs iudgement, prudence and counſail, how we may, as it becometh vs, gouerne and rule our ſelues, in ſo great and ſo harde a matter. Truly this whole treatiſe is to this end that they that be in ſuch diſtreſſes ſhoulde deſier and receyue from heauen that modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and prudence, not folowynge the counſel of the fleſhe to ſeke ſome ſhiftes to eſcape. But ther be that do obiect in this place, that the lorde Ieſus yea whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was aſked woulde make to them no anſwere. But I ſaye that this ſufficeth not to take awaye that rule, which he hath geuen to vs, to witnes our fayth then when the confeſſion thereof is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required. Furthermore, that he did neuer diſſemble or kepe ſilence for this purpoſe to ſaue hys lyfe. Laſt of all that he dyd neuer make ſo doubtfull an anſwere, but it conteined an apt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of that which he had ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, or els did firſt ſatiſfie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that lay in waite to marke both his words &amp; dedes Wherfore let al chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be wel perſua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded &amp; ſure of this thing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man oght
<pb facs="tcp:18640:45"/> more to eſteme his life then the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the truth wherin god wil haue the praiſe &amp; glory of his name to appear. Is it without a cauſe that he calleth his witneſſes (for this doeth the worde martyr ſignifie) who are broughte to make anſwere before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies of faith and religion? Or is not this rather the cauſe, for that he wold vſe al their ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng and whole courſe of life to the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſion of his name? Wherein euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt not ſo loke to his neighbour &amp; fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he will ſeme to do nothyng at al without his example and teſtimonie. And this curioſitie is ſo much the more to be eſchued becauſe we are prone to this vice of our own nature. Peter whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had heard of Chriſt that he ſhould be led in his old age whether he would not he enquired what ſhuld become of Iohn his felow &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion. There is none of vs, which to auoide perill and daunger, woudl not gladly make anſwere in that wiſe, becauſe when we ſhoulde ſuffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, by and by this cometh into our minde, what is the cauſe wherefore I ſhoulde ſuffer more then others. But Ieſus Chriſt doth cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel &amp; moniſh other
<pb facs="tcp:18640:45"/> wiſe vs al in comon, and euerie man pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uatly, to be prepared and readie, that as he calleth one or other, ſo euerie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forth in his ordre. And I haue ſhewed this before, that we ſhalbe vnarmed and vnprepared to take and ſuffer martyrdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onleſſe we be fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed and armed with the promiſes of god. Now remaineth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare plentifully ſuch promiſes, not that we wil ſett forth euerie one exactli but to ſhewe the chefe and moſt excellent thing, wich god wold haue vs to hope for, to comforte vs in our calamities. And there be thre ſuch thinges, the firſt that ſeing al the times both of our lyfe and death do conſiſt in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, he wil ſo defend vs by his power, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> not one heare of our head ſhal fall but after hys wyll. Wherfore al faitfull men oght thus to be perſwaded, in whoſe handes ſo euer they be toſſed, that god in no wiſe will lay a ſide that gouernaunce &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie, which he hath taken vpon him for them with ſo great care. Yf this perſwa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion of gods fatherly care and prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce did reſt and cleaue depe in our hartes we ſhuld be deliuered out of hand, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſt part of theſe doubtes &amp; difficulties,
<pb facs="tcp:18640:46"/> which do now trouble &amp; hinder our duty We behold now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bitterneſſ of the tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unts, &amp; vnbridled crueltie, brawling pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhly in al ſharpnes of puniſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. And here by we iudge that god hath no more care, nor regard to defend and kepe vs in ſauetie. And therfore we be ſo ſtirred &amp; prouoked, by our own reaſons to looke and prouide, for our ſelues, as though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole hope of gods helpe and ſuccour were clean taken awaie. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, the ſo great prouidence of god as he hath ſhewed vnto vs, oght to be vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to vs like a ſtronge fenced caſtle, which can be ouercome with no power. Let vs therefore learn and hold faſt, thys ſhort ſentence, that our bodies are in his hand &amp; power, who alſo did creat them. And this is the cauſe, wherfore god hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered hys, after a merueilouſe ſorte, and contrarie the opinyon and hope of all men, as Sydrach, Miſach, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denago, forth of the burning ouen, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel out of the lions denne, peter out of Herods priſon, where in he was ſhort &amp; watched moſt dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly faſt bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in chai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes. By theſe examples he wold declare vnto vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could ſtaye our enemies as
<pb facs="tcp:18640:46"/> it were with a certaine bridle, and that he had that power that when he wold, he could preſerue and as it were pluk vs out of the mouth of death it ſelf. Not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he doeth alwaies thus deliuer his from ſuch perils, but of right hauing the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie to apoint our life &amp; death, he will haue vs perſuaded, that we are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and kept vnder his cuſtodye and tuition, that what ſo euer the tyraunts do inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or with what furie ſo euer thei ſet vpon vs, yet it is only in his hand to apoint lyfe or death: and therefore thys mater oght onely to be refferred to hys wil. But yf he ſuffer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teraunts to kyl vs, yet our life is vnto him deare &amp; much more ſett by of hym then it is worthie. The which he did plainly declare to be ſo when he pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced by the mouth Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uid, that the death of his ſaints was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and preciouſe in his ſight. And alſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſay by eſay, that the earth it ſelf ſhuld ſhew forth the bloud that was ſhedde which ſemeth al to gether hidden. Now then let the enemies of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> goſpel be as bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiful &amp; prodigal in ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> martyrs bloud, as thei wil yet this muſt be, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei ſhal make a reckening &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:18640:47"/> horrible accompt of the effuſion of that deare and precious blood, yea euen to the vttermoſt droppe. But nowe, in thys time thei do ſcornefully and proud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly laugh, when thei burne the faithfull men, and after they haue dipt &amp; waſhed them ſelues in their blood, they become ſo dronken, that they care nothing at al what murthers thei do. But if we wyll haue this ſtay and moderation of mind, that we can paciently abide, god wil at the laſt declare, that it was not without a cauſe that he ſo greatly eſtemed our life, and had it in ſo great honour. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane while, let vs not take it to grief, yf it be now beſtowed to confirme &amp; gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſh the goſpel, which excelleth heauen and earth in worthines. And that we may be more ſurely perſuaded that god wil neuer leaue vs as abiectes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ds of the enemies, let vs not forget that ſame ſaying of Ieſus Chriſt, wherein he ſaieth, that it is he himſelf who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men do perſecute in his membres. God had ſaid before by Zachary, who ſo toucheth you toucheth the ſight of mine eie.</p>
            <p>This is much more expreſſed, if we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the goſpell ſake, it is euen as the
<pb facs="tcp:18640:47"/> ſonne of him ſelfe were and ſuffered in that affliction. Therefore let vs thinke ſo that Ieſus Chriſt muſt forget himſelf if he ſhould haue no care and thought of vs at the time when we be in priſon and danger of life for his cauſe and glory: &amp; let vs alſo know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God wyl take al the contumelies and iniuries, as done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne ſonne. Let vs come to the ſeconde place of conſolation, which is one of the greateſt among gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: that god wyll ſo hold vs vp wyth the vertue of his ſpirit in theſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that our enemies whatſoeuer they do, nor Satan their chiefe captaine ſhal in any thyng go awaye with the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand. And truly we do ſee howe in that neceſſitie, he doth ſhew the ſuccour and helpes of his grace. For the inuincible ſtoutnes and conſtancie of minde which is ſene in the true martyrs, is a notable token of that ſame moſt mighty power which god vſeth in his ſainctes. There be two things in perſecutions greuous tediouſe &amp; intolrable to the fleſh where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one conſiſteth in the checkes and rebuks of men, the other in the payne &amp; torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the body. In both theſe kinds
<pb facs="tcp:18640:48"/> of temtations god doth promiſe ſo his aſſiſtaunce that we ſhal eaſely ouercom al the infamie &amp; violence of the grefes and payn. And truly what he promiſeth he doth performe in dede with moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and aſſured helpe. Let vs then take this bucklere to defend vs againſt al feare, and let vs not meaſure the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of gods ſpirit ſo ſclendrely, that we ſhuld not thinke and beleue, that he wil eaſely ouercome all the iniuries, bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and contumelies of men. And of this diuine and inuincible operation, emong all other we haue a notable example in this our age. A certaine yonge man, who liued godlylye here with vs in this cytie, when he was taken at Dornick was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned with this ſentence, that yf he wold denye the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his faith he ſhuld be but beheaded, but yf he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuered in his purpaſed opinion, he ſhuld be burned. When he was aſked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he wold do, he anſwered plainly, he who will geue me thys grace to dye patiently for his name, wil alſo work by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſelfe ſame grace, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may abide broy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and burni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. We oght to take thys ſentence not as pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced of a mortall
<pb facs="tcp:18640:48"/> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy goſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhold thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo wel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme; &amp; make vs ouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>com al payns &amp; torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as to moue vs to take any other kinde of meker death in good part. Yea we ſee &amp; often times, what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy he geueth to euel &amp; wicked men, who ſuffer for their euel dedes and wickednes. I do not ſpeake of ſuch as be obſtinat &amp; hardned in their wickednes, which haue no repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch do perceaue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, &amp; ſo do take &amp; ſuffer quietly &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good wil moſt greuous &amp; ſharpe pain as we ſee a notable example in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thefe who turned at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of our lord Ieſus chriſt. Wil god who aſſiſteth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo great power wicked men that ſuffer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dingly for their euell actes, forſake them who defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his cauſe, &amp; wil he not rather geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inuincible power? The third place of promiſes, which god promiſeth to his martyres, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruit which thei oght to loke for of their ſufferi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; of death it ſelf yf nede ſo requier. But this fruit is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter they haue ſet forth &amp; honoured gods name, &amp; edified his church w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, they may be gathered together in immortall glory with the lord Ieſus.
<pb facs="tcp:18640:49"/> But becauſe we haue ſpoken largely inough before of this reward of eternal glory, it is now ſufficient, to renue the memorie of thoſe thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs that are already ſpoken. Wherfore let the faithful learn to reare vp their head to the crowne of immortall glory, whereunto god doeth call them, let them not take the loſſe of this life greuouſly, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and worthines of the reward. And that thei may be ſure and perfectly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of this ſo great a good thing, as can not be expreſſed with any ſpeache, nor in thought be comprehended, nor w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any honour inough eſtemed, let them haue continually before their eyes this like and conformable reaſon with our Lord Ieſus Chriſt that in death it ſelfe they beholde life, as he by ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the croſſe &amp; infamie came to glorious reſurrection, wherin all our felicitie, triumph and ioy conſiſteth.

<pb facs="tcp:18640:50"/> in al, that thei ſeke their felicitie and principal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, none other where, but in this preſent life ſubiect to corrup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion. The which thing declareth moſte euidently that men whiche haue caſte downe their myndes, hope and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, from the dignitie and excellencye of their nature, are ſo degenerat and growen out of kinde, that thei ſeeme vt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terly to be brute beaſtes. For we were created to another end farre contrarye, that whiles we remain in this worlde, we ſhould with our whole minde &amp; care contende towardes the heauenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. And this is the very cauſe wherefore this preſent lyfe is named a certain pilgrimage courſe or trauaile.</p>
            <p>Wherefore who ſoeuer will not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly and willingly depriue himſelf of the eternall inheritance of the kingdom of god, he muſt nedes begin his courſe and iorney at this principle to wit, that he oght to cut of al the foliſhe &amp; light de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires wherby he may be reteined &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden in the worlde: ſo that his chiefe care &amp; deſier always be to draw nere vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to God, and that he haue none impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that in minde &amp; deſier at the
<pb facs="tcp:18640:50"/> leaſt he haſt thither. In minde I ſay and deſier at the leaſt, becauſe it were greatly to be deſired and wiſhed, that all earthly affections, which do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe vs from God, ſhoulde be vtterly plucked vp &amp; rooted forth of our mindes that we might ſpedily paſſe ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> race and ſpace of this world which we haue to runne thorow, and to atteyne to that place whither our iorney lieth. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſo far vnable to haue ſuch a mynde as is pure and voyde from all euel affections: this remaineth that we conquer and ouercome all the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes that hynder vs, that what faut or ſtoppe ſo euer be in vs, we purſue our courſe with that minde and deſire, that in our greateſt infirmities, we alwayes preferre the heauenly life to al worldly thinges. But nowe let vs conſider by what wayes and meanes we may learn this. It neither lieth in mans wit nor authoritie, to inuent or appoint them: but thoſe wayes are to be troden and holden, which god hath ordeined and ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pointed vnto vs whereof the chiefe and moſt ſure are here named of Dauid, that is to ſay, the order and policie and ſtate
<pb facs="tcp:18640:51"/> of a churche ſo gouerned, that we maye be taught therein and inſtructed in the worde of god, that we may worſhip him with common conſent, &amp; pray vnto him and praiſe him with one voyce, &amp; haue the right vſe of his ſacramentes as the aydes and ſtayes of his whole worſhip and religion. For theſe are the rules wherein we muſt exerciſe our ſelf, that we may be confirmed in faith, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feare of god, in holines, finally in contempte of the worlde and loue of the heauenly life. And to this purpoſe and none other perteineth Dauids teſtimonie and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that emonges many thinges which he was moued to wiſhe and deſire in his baniſhment this was the chiefe &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal that he might dwel in the temple of god. For vnder this name of the tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple he doth comprehend that fredome &amp; libertie, wheteby he may both worſhip god purely &amp; godly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the faithfull, and geue the confeſſion of his faith, prayſe god and make his praiers, and to be par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taker aſwel of al theſe ſo great comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and ioyes, as alſo of the ſacraments which were in that temple rightly and lawfully inſtitute. For at that time in
<pb facs="tcp:18640:51"/> dede God had choſen a certaine place, in the which he commanded to offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto him, and to ſhew him all reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and honour: whereby thei might profeſſe and teſtifie that he was their only god in whom thei put their truſt, by whoſe lawe they ſhould be inſtructed and finally ſhuld ther haue al the toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of hys preſence. And doubtles he hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf vttereth moſt plainlye, what it is that he chiefly regardeth in this requeſt when he deſireth to dwell in the temple of god, ſeyng he doth ioygne this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, that he doth require this for that cauſe that he may behold the beauty of the Lorde. Wherein he declareth that the temple of it ſelfe was nothyng, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he had faſtened his eyes vpon it alone, but that he rather had his hart and hys minde bent vpon that vſe and worſhyp whereunto it was conſecrate and appointed.</p>
            <p>If we ſholde ſuppoſe that he regarded or deſyred nothing ſaue the buildyng made of woode &amp; ſtone we ſholde iudge far a myſſe and iniuriouſly of this moſt godly and wyſe man: for this colde not be geuen hym as a commendation of
<pb facs="tcp:18640:52"/> vertue but a wicked ſuperſtition. We muſt therfore rather iudge and beleue of ſuch a man, that by the declaration of ſuche a feruent deſyre he hath teſtified, how honorable he eſteamed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> outward order and regiment wherby the faithful are gouerned in the churche. And to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in fewe wordes what I iudge hereof he ſignifieth and declareth that it is a ſingular benefite and ſuche a ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rogatyue as can not for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great dignitie therof ſufficiently be pryced to remaine and lyue in the churche, that he may be partaker of all thoſe thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs wherby God doth vouchſafe to allure and to ioyngne his children vnto hym. And let vs note diligently his dignitie and authoritie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpeaketh thus. For he was not one of the rude multitude a man w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience, but the moſte ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent prophete that euer was bothe in vertue and knowledge and inſpiration of the holy ghoſte.</p>
            <p>He doth not here ſpeake what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable or comfortable for the multitude but in this peticio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing only regarde of his own profite and welthe, he dothe witnes moſte planly, that he neithere
<pb facs="tcp:18640:52"/> wiſheth nor deſyreth any thinge more earneſtly, then to be in that company &amp; aſſimbly of the people of god, wherin he may declare his faithe, and may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme and edefye himſelfe, by the holy ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the holſome doctryne there preached. Nether gyueth, he this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in this place only but alſo in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other he declareth his moſte feruent deſyre to the ſame as in the former pſal. he ſaith, O lord I loue the habitacion of thy houſe, and the place wherin thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hath his reſidens. Again pſalme .xlii. lyke as the Hyndebrayeth for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brokes ſo my ſoul panteth after god my ſoull is a thyrſt for God euen, for the lyuing God ſaing, whan ſhall I come and appeare, before god? It had bene enogh to haue ſayd theſe wordes but his vehement affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth cary him hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her. For emmediatly he addeth that he was fed with teares in ſteade of breade al that time that he was abſent &amp; colde not come to the temble of god. And he forthermore adioyned that this hearte is powred forth lyke water, within hym ſelfe, for the remembrance of that tyme whan he come to the, temple with the
<pb facs="tcp:18640:53"/> multitude of the faithfull to prayſe God The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after ſo many &amp; ſo greate morni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs and wailings, and deſyres moſt lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bly oppreſſed, he fyndeth no better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forthe then in that expectacion and hope which he conceiueth of god, that he wyl reſtore agayne vnto hym the benefyte &amp; comforth whiche he had loſte. My ſoule ſaith he why arte thou ſo vexed ſo vnqui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>et and troubled within me? put thy truſt in God for I wyll yet giue hym thankes for the comforthe of his countenaunce. And in the .lxxxiiii. pſalme he declareth an eſpeciall deſyre of goinge to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle and viſitinge, the courte of God, for after he had made an exclamation. O lorde of hoaſtes how amiable is thy tabernacle? he ſaith that his hearte and bodye dyd leape and dance for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earneſt deſyre to enter into the courte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord, and he giueth this reaſon: for thei are al Bleſſed that dwell in the houſe of God: becauſe they do praiſe him, that is to ſay they acknowledge his benefites with a thankfull minde and with one comune conſent and yelding a confeſſion of their faith do glorifie hym.</p>
            <p>Now whan Dauid ſuche a worthy man
<pb facs="tcp:18640:53"/> which was ſo deaply grounded in al god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lynes &amp; religion who lyued in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde lyke an Angell ſente from heauen doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelfe nothing notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding to haue nede of ſuche aydes meanes and ſpurres as God hath appointed to hys people, what is to be ſuppoſed of vs I be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeche you, who are ſo rude and carnall, and whoſe faithe is ſo weake whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is ſo colde and barren? Surely we oght thus to iudge and thinke of our ſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues, that although dauid for his perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> colde haue wanted theſe inferiour aydes and helpes, yet vnto vs they are alwai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es moſte neceſſary, namely for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie wherwith we are oppreſſed con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinually. But wherof doubte we? Such as haue attained to greater perfection, &amp; more worthy commendation of vertue, do better vnderſtande how muche they yet wante then thoſe which haue no ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue at all. Dauid was endued &amp; adorned with Angelical vertues. The which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of vertues and perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in him maketh hym better to vnderſtande and perceiue, how neceſſary, it was vnto hym, and how mete for the comforth of his conſcience, and his ſaluation, to be
<pb facs="tcp:18640:54"/> ſtyrrid vp and inflamed more and more to the loue and deſyre of a godly lyfe, by the preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, by ſacraments, and other ſuche like exerciſes. But theſe great boaſters voyde of all vertues, but notable in all ſyns and vices which at this day deſpyce things ſo excellent, ſo neceſſary, ſo holſome, declare thereby moſte euidently that they haue not one droppe of Chriſten religion and true ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lynes. I do ſpeake of ſuch great clarkes and graue philoſophers, in corners and chambers which do lyue in the papiſtry not profeſſing any religion.</p>
            <p>Suche do ſay, O it is a goodly matter and muche to the purpoſe, that no man can be a, Chriſtian onles he runne to Geneua, that he may there fyl his eares with the ſarmons &amp; vſe ſuch ceremonies as in that citie are obſerued, can not we ourſelues euery one, alone bothe reade and praye? what? muſt we all nedes go, to the churche to be taught, when euery one hath the ſcripture at home. To the which things I do thus anſwer. We do binde no man to departe from that place wherin he dwelleth and hath his certa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e trade. But rather if my ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do liue pure<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:18640:54"/> and godly vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame tiranny of the pope, and worſhip. God as he oghte, I will accompt him of far greatter pryce, then vs that haue this reſt and lyberty. But heare I muſt demande .ii. queſtions firſt, whether ſuche do ſyn which feeling their infirmitie and weaknes do reſorte to ſome Chriſtian churche, that thei may fynde there that comforte and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of conſcience whiche Dauid ſought for at Ieruſalem in his time? Secondly, whether that all generally, euen ſuche as be reteined and oppreſſed by violence, oght not to ſobbe &amp; to ſyghe to mourne and to lament, when they ſe themſelues deſtitute of thoſe means, and far of from thoſe waies whiche might, guyde them and bringe them vnto God. The brute beaſtes which wante all reaſon, do crye for fode whan hounger, aſſaileth. And ſhall they whiche profeſſe themſelues to be the ſons of God haue no care nor con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſideration of that thing, wherin onli the moſt holſome fode of faithe and the moſt ſtable comforth therof is conteined? Or can thei not be thus content, thus proud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly themſelfe to treade vnder fote the gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces of God ſo excellent and precious on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les
<pb facs="tcp:18640:55"/> alſo they deryde them which flye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſtrange countryes to ſeeke ſuche com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forthe by Godly zeale and do enioye the ſame with moſt pleaſant, tranquillitie of the mynde and ioye of the ſpirit wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in their proude ſtomak and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> arrogancy wherby they are broght to this opinion to iudge ſermons, ſacraments and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke prayers vnprofitable and vaine for them is ſo ſure and cleare a teſtimony y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they oghte to be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate and caſte forthe of the churche, that there nede none other witnes. For paull dothe not ſay that this order which the lorde hath appointed in his churche, doth only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine to the rude and ignorant, but that it is, commune to all membres, of the churche without exception, of any. The lorde ſaithe he, hath ordeined teachers, Apoſtles and paſtors to the reſtauratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſaints, to the edification of the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy of chriſt, vntill we all do come to the vnitie of faith, to a parfyte man, to the meaſure of a perfyte age in Chriſt. firſte of all let vs, note that he ſaith, not that god had lefte his ſcripture for eueri man to reade it alone, but that he hathe orde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned ſuche a policy and ordre of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,
<pb facs="tcp:18640:55"/> wherin certain men appoi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted ſhold teache others: by the which only offyce he vnderſtandeth comprehendeth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which, depende of the ſame doctrine. Wherfore thoughe euery man may pryuately reade it, yet this oght to be no hinderance but that, they ſholde heare it ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly. But who are they whom he calleth to this, publike doctrine and diſcipline? Bothe hyghe and lowe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exception. What dothe he binde it to one day? No ſurely, but he comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to vſe continually this order of pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like and eccleſiaſtical diſcipline vnto the laſte ende of our lyfe, euen to the day of deathe wherin beginneth our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Suche therfore as diſdaigne to be broght vnder this, diſcipline as vnto a certain order wherby they being gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the commune order of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, maye growe forwarde in faithe and in all kinde of vertues, can cutte them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of from the communion and felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the chyldren of God by nothing ſo muche: Let them excuſe the matter as fynely and craftely as they liſte. For the ſentence of paul is moſt euident, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none is of Chriſts body neither can or oght to
<pb facs="tcp:18640:56"/> be compted a membre thereof, onles he ſubmit himſelfe to this commune rule &amp; order. Wherfore deare brethren, Let vs not ſo proudly lifte vp our harts: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther derecte and caſt, downe our ſelues, and let vs, not tempte God with thys great temeritie, thinking ourſelues able to flye without wings. But ſome man wyll obiecte: That dauid did ſpeake of that time, whan the ſhadowes &amp; figures were in their force. For God then gouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned his people like children with child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diſcipline. As ſante paull ſpeaketh, and therfore thoſe ſo feruent, deſyres do not belonge to vs at this preſent eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally now, ſeing we are compared, vnto them, who bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g paſſed their infancy and childhode are growne to a more ſtronge and ſtable age. Aganſt the which opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and reaſon thus I anſwer: that we haue as great neceſſitie as had the ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theres, to be taught by ſermones, to be confirmed by ſacraments, to be exerciſed in commune prayers, and to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our faith. And to this purpoſe pertaine ſo manye promiſes, eſpecially thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Eſay writeth: by whom god pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth that his churche ſhall haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb facs="tcp:18640:56"/> children, whome it ſhall, not only conceiue and beare but, alſo noriſhe and bring vp. The whiche, thinge can by no means be denied but that, it perteineth vnto the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt, and to this oure, time eſpecially. Now God dothe planely and euidently ſend home her children into, the boſome and lappe of the churche, their mother and norce. And wherfore dothe he ſo, but that an or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der &amp; rule myght be kept which he hath appointed to gather, and kepe together his flockes in the churche. The which thing alſo is expreſſed, lyuely by a very apte and godly ſimitude which the ſame prophet vſeth where he ſaith in the .liii. chapter that the Chriſtians ſhall be like dooues which come to gether by flights into their doouecotes. And what is that doouecote I pray you, and commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e cote of comforthe for all the faithfull but the place wherin the worde of God is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, the ſacraments are, miniſtred and the name of God is called vpon and prai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed? And ſurely thoſe which thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo ſtable and ſtronge, that thei haue no nede of this order and gouernance do not yet wel vnderſtande their own ſtate
<pb facs="tcp:18640:57"/> and condition. For why hath God ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and appointed vs the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts but that whiles we are cloſed about and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with theſe bodies, we are ouerdull to perceiue ſpirituall things, onles we be holpen vp with ſuch corporall things and ſygnes which may be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by our ſyghts and ſenſes. The angels haue the veretie and truth of the ſacraments, the which is to them ſufficient: but our rude<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes and ignorance requireth that God ſubmitt hymſelfe much more vnto vs, &amp; applye himſelfe to the, weaknes of oure capacitie. But theſe fantaſticall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians which are led with their falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nions and vaine, imaginations of their proude hearte, muſt ſpoyle, themſelues of their bodies and tranſforme themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues into angels and then truly thei ſhal not nede, theſe ſmall aydes, and helpes whiche they now ſo, ſmally do regarde. Notwithſtandinge they whiche, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the vſe and libertie of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes and of the comforthe of callyng vpon his name and can not feall theire miſery to mourne, for the ſame doe far paſſe all brute beaſtes in, dulnes inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:18640:57"/>
            <p>Moreouer this I do affirme that if. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid had a iuſt &amp; neceſſarie cauſe to make this exclamation, O lorde, how amiable is thy temple. Bleſſed are thei that dwel in thy houſe. My ſoule is, kendled with moſte feruent, deſire to enter, into the courtes of the lord: then haue we, this day a far greater, more iuſte and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary cauſe, that we ſhoulde be enflamed with care loue and deſyre, of the churche of God. For what were thoſe godly and comfortable things of the temple wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Dauid had ſuche neceſſitie, that being abſent and depryued of them, he dyd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte his lyfe altogether bitter and vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pleaſant: They were in effecte and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the ſame that, we haue this day. How be it we do knowe that they were but darke ſhadowes wherby god did not ſo declare and ſet forthe his grace, as he hath at this preſent powred it oute and made it to ſhine before our eies. For god hathe opened and vttered himſelfe vnto vs in the hole order of his church ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cifully and ſo familiarly, that the verye heauens ſeameth after a ſorte to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto vs. Neither do the ſacraments ſignifye Ieſus Chriſte afar, of vnto vs
<pb facs="tcp:18640:58"/> lyke as vnder the lawe: but they paynte hym before our eies. Wherfore we muſt nedes be to muche vnthankfull excepte we do preferre theſe ſo great and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent benefytes, which God beſtoweth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, to that comforth and Ioye whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch was offered vnto dauid in the temple of zion. We are not now, in the vtter courtes as, Dauid ſpeaketh, neither is there ani veal Drawne ani more to hold vs backe frome the ſantuari wherefore i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyll affirme plainely that we ſmally re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>garde and do not rightly know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of ſo liberall benefites, when oure deſyers are not equall at the leaſt to the godly zele of dauid. And this do I ſpeake to teach the matter ſimply and plaineli: as for exhortation it ſhall folow after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in due place. Now then let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what was his ſo great zele &amp; deſier y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> therunto we may apply &amp; frame our life as vnto a certain form, and rule wherby we ſhulde lead our lyfe. One thing ſaith he, haue I required of the lorde, where ſpeaking of one certaine thing he dothe ſignifie that he was ſo deſirous and care full thereof that he contemned al othere and deſpiſed, them as thogh he had vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb facs="tcp:18640:58"/> forgotten them.</p>
            <p>And had Dauid all other things to be de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyred ſo at wyll, that he wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this one thing which he ſo earneſtly required? Nay ſurely he was baniſhed his contrey and fled from place to place as an exile. And in the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile and banyſhement he wanted hys fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, and the moſte ſwete com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his frendes &amp; familiars, he was ſpoyled of all hys goodes, depryued of moſte hyghe honors and dignities whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch he had in his contrey, hys wyfe was taken from him. Finally he ſeamed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exile to be a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpoiled of al good things and commodities and vtterly deformed and defaced with, all calmities and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, yet for all this of ſo many ſo great and moſte comfortable things which he then wanted, the wante of none was ſo greuous and painfull vnto hym, as that he might not go and haue the exerciſe in the temple, emongs others, lyke as he concludeth the ſame thing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary affection of gladnes, whan he had, all things at, pleaſure, where he gyueth thankes vnto God for all the benefytes which he had aboundantly beſtowed vp
<pb facs="tcp:18640:59"/> on hym &amp; after he had ſpoken of meate drinke and reſt and other corporall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende of the pſalme he thus concludeth his prayer &amp; thankeſgeuing: that he wyll dwell, all the tyme of hys lyfe in the temple and houſe of God. By the which deſyre and earneſt purpoſe he teſtifieth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in all his welthe, pleaſures and quietnes, he cared for nothing more nor compted any thing more pleaſant or more precious, then that kinde of lyfe &amp; conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherin he was like a ſhepe in the flocke of the faithfull and ther fed moſte ſweatly, that ſo he might be led to the chiefe felicitie. Wherfore let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider diligently, that Dauid in all hys changes both in aduerſitie &amp; proſperitie reteined that mynde and deſyre, that he might vſe that libertie continually whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch God had geuen to the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael: which can be compted no ſmall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. For we ſee very many, who when they are in danger and diſtreſſe in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and miſery do remember God glad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly: but ſo ſoone as they are delyuered &amp; haue eſkaped all dangers, when their are once as they wolde be, then caſt they all memory and remembrance of God forth
<pb facs="tcp:18640:59"/> of their mynds, yea and which is moſte ſhamfull, they rage and flynge vp their heeles aganſt God, lyke horſſe that are fed and kepte ouer proudly. And others do beare ſuche aduerſitie ſo heauily and greauouſly and are ſo angry &amp; grudging aganſt God that they are moſte greau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly offendid if there be any thing but ſpoken of God. But Dauid had a far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mynde towards God alwayes.</p>
            <p>was he not ſo, afflicted and oppreſſed with calamities &amp; miſeries paſſing nom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber and meaſure, that he ſeemed moſte miſerable of all men in the worlde? Yet was the grief of his minde ſo farre from woundyng and oppreſing him, that he ſholde be trobled or grieued at the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarywiſe that ſame mention that he maketh of his moſt gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uous ſorowes is a moſt ſwete comforth vnto him, euen then when he is not able to thinke any thinge of, God but with this complante, that he is baniſhed from the temple and depryued of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and other exerciſes of the faithe: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles the conſideration and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion for thoſe, diſcommodities was moſt pleaſant vnto him of al other thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs
<pb facs="tcp:18640:60"/> Now of the other ſide whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtate was changed &amp; he was reſtored to al honor &amp; proſperitie, was he therby cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged? Dyd he not ſo ouercom his enemies y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he enioi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdom wel &amp; peaceably drad of all men? Had he not alſo that aboundance of all thynges ſuche plenty and libertie that he might haue geuen hymſelfe to enioye all pleaſures? Yet dothe he ſtyll keape that conſtant minde and purpoſe, that he alwaes eſteameth and iudgeth it to be hys onely felicitie, that he hath acceſſe and entrye into the temple of god that he may be partaker of the order ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pointed in the church. Therefore doe we ſee that he profeſſeth boldly and Godly, that he hath not in vaine required of the lorde this one thinge ſo ofte and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly. For this was ſo deare vnto hym and ſo muche deſyred, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he colde be wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to giue al his other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors &amp; Ioyes for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now let vs conſidre whiche of vs hathe the deſyre and iudgment that dauid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had. Wyl they think you (who ſet their hole felicitie in thoſe goodes which they now enioie) prefere this libertie to call vpon the name of God purely, to heare
<pb facs="tcp:18640:60"/> his worde, to vſe his ſacramentes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their accuſtomed commodities and pleaſures? Nay verely, they are all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo broght a ſleape with the feading of their panſhe and fatte bely, &amp; dreame ſo muche of their delites and pleaſures, that they care for nothing but to pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre their carkes and to lyue delicately. And to ſpeake the matter at a word ſuch is the Iudgement and deſyre of the hole worlde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it had rather to haue a troghe farced and fylled with meate, lyke a fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſwyne all gyuen to the bely, &amp; more they ſet by it then by the holy temple of God. So ſoone as any talke or rumor is rayſed of thoſe warres, and tumultes which are begonne al ready and are like mo to folow more greauous, euery man dothe feare the ſpoyle of hys goodes and other deſcomomodities trobles and dan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers which do enſeue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres. But to loſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to want y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pure adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and other helpes and exercciſes of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherwith, we are ioyned vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to God no man maketh mencion, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dothe ſo greate an euell and pery<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lous Danger, any whytte moue, vs.
<pb facs="tcp:18640:61"/> Neither do we ſee them that are vtterly deſtitute and depryued of theſe ſo many and ſo greate treaſures and comforthes greatly care for them: Onles ther rents and reuenewes be able, to keape them thorow out the hole yeare and manteine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that ſtate of lyfe, pompe &amp; vanitie wherunto ther ambition moueth them: if the wayes and means of keping their trade and encreaſing their ſubſtance doe faile, if they loſe their honour and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation emongs men.</p>
            <p>They are ſo, trobled and vexed that they thinke themſelues vtterly vndone wheras in the mean ceaſon they vtterly defye and ſet at noghte the peculiar and true foode the ordinary and vſual meate of the ſons of God for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which thei ſhold be moſte hungry &amp; carefull yet the lorde threatning by his prophete y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wolde ſend a famine, not of bread &amp; water but of the worde of God dothe declare plane<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no greatter euell can come vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherfore deare brethen let vs take head with all care, ſtudye and diligence, leſte we by the ſnares of Sathan and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticement of the world become ſo brutiſh that we lothe and deſpiſe this ſo great
<pb facs="tcp:18640:61"/> goodnes, ſo neceſſary to ſaluation: but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we do compte it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſte deare &amp; precious thinge, of all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can be beſtowed vpon vs in this lyfe. This is it I meane that we ſhuld remane continually in Gods folde vnder y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rule, diſcipline &amp; order y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche he hath appointed emongs his people. The which thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g is more planli declared &amp; ſet forth by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which dauid adioyneth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wyll require again y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g which he be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore had aſked: wherby he ſignifieth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was not enflamed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any ſodaine paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſhortly after was feble &amp; colde, to haue this care of religion, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was then conſtant &amp; wold ſo remane in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching for this principall matter. We do ſee ſome whiche are moued with ſuche a feruent zele &amp; ſodane motion, that the nexte day after they be ſo touched, they ſeame ready to forſake, all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer they haue. But that conſtancy wherof dauid ſpeaketh is a certane rare &amp; ſpeciall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. In ſo much y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the moſt part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in whoſe mindes any zele of religion hath bene kendled, wheras thei oght to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe that fire y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther zele and loue might encreace thei do wilingly extinguiſhe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame. But as concerni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g dauid, we haue
<pb facs="tcp:18640:62"/> the like teſtimony in that pſalme which I before alledged. For where it, might haue bene ſaid vnto him, that bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and dryuen from Iury, he might go heare or there, to ſome othere place, he maketh an exclamation: Thine alters o lord of hoſtes, my God and my kinge, as thoghe he ſhuld ſay. That thoghe he had at commandement and poſſeſſed all the palaces of the world, yet colde he fynde no place, pleaſant nor acceptable vnto him, whiles that he had no acceſſe to the temple of God, he doth alſo complaine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſparrowes &amp; ſwallowes doth finde them forthe places to buylde ther neſts there: but his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition was much worſe. why ſo I pray you? Was it becauſe he had ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther kitchin nor chamber? Not ſo: But becauſe he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de no place mete nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, for hym to lead his life therin wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was ſecluded from the altars of God. And in this baniſhment no place colde be ſo pleaſant, but he wold compte it bit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter to dwell therin. Now this is moſte certane y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> if this doctrine were well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded vnto our hearts we ſhold not be ſo much hindred, or rather ſo w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exerciſe &amp; practiſe of thoſe meanes

We take not in hand here to diſpute whether god can gouerne and leade his people w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any inferiour aides or meanes, but to declare howe his will is to gouerne and guide vs &amp; to reteyne vs in his true wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip and ſeruice. For this is certain that god of his great loue &amp; mercie ſeing our infirmitie and weakenes, hath geuen vs as it were certain aydes &amp; ſtayes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we being weake and feable might be ſtayed. What foly I pray you, and how great foliſhnes is this, when we feele our feete to faile, and our legges to bow vnder vs to contemne and deſpiſe theſe ſo great and neceſſarye helpes to prop &amp; ſtay our feete, as though there were no profit at all of ſuch thinges. Wherefore what difference ſoeuer is betwene vs &amp; the Iewes, yet muſt we know that this doctrine which Dauid here ſetteth forth is common for al. The name of the temple onely muſt be changed becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are no more bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d nor tied to one certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place
<pb facs="tcp:18640:65"/> But as concerning the order &amp; maner to worſhip God truly, which Dauid chiefly regarded, that perteineth as much vnto vs as to hym. Now proude men which haue a falſe opinion of themſelfe wil not much regarde this exerciſe of religion &amp; order by God appointed that the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhoulde come to one place to heare the worde of God to make publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to vſe and receiue the ſacramentes. But we thogh there came no profit, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it is the moſt holy inſtitution of God himſelf, wolde yet reſt thervpon moſt wilingly, and wold giue him moſt hearty thankes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it pleaſeth him by ſuch means to cheriſhe &amp; ſuſteine our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie how be it yet as we haue before decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red we do feale y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruite of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which cometh vnto vs of this inſtitution &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of god to be moſt abundant and moſte excellent.

For I do graunte vndouttedly that god dothe preſerue his vnder the tyranny of Antichriſte, and that miſerable captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, althoghe they do wante theſe aydes and helpes which we haue with greate libertie. The worde of God is not prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto them, neither haue they any place wherin it is lawfull to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their faith, yea y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacraments are taken away from them.

Why do thei ſo? but that they can not abyde to be admoniſhed by vs and to be wakened as it were forthe of ſlepe, that they may haue ſome ſauour and felyng of thoſe euyls wherein they are.

The bell may well ring daily &amp; call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together. But it is ſufficient for ſuche if then at laſt they come forth in the ende of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weke vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church &amp; company of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation. Thei are called four times euery ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>day, but thei come very notably, if thei once may be ſeene to haue beene there. For there be many of them alſo whych take to them thys lyberty that they wyll ſcarſe come euery .xv. Daye. And ſurelye the moſte parte prooueth thys prouerbe to be trewe that beyng
<pb facs="tcp:18640:69"/> nygh to the Churche they are verye farre from god. And ſome of them be of that ſort which haue lefte their contrey that they might ſerue god, who yet in this part of gods ſeruice do ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues ouer negligent. What oght we tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do? Seing god doeth ſo ſhew himſelfe vnto vs let vs beholde his beauty: &amp; not paſſe by the meanes whereby we may moſt clearely haue the fruition &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plation of this his beautie. That is to ſay to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may be moued &amp; as it were rauiſhed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the loue of him &amp; as S. Paul ſaith that we be tranſformed &amp; changed into his ſimitude &amp; likenes. And to come to this point, we muſt conſider more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently &amp; earneſtly then we haue accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed what god doth propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto vs in his church. For what is the cauſe I pray you, why we do take ſo ſmale pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the ſermons &amp; ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but that we giue no diligence to the things that are their ſpoken &amp; done? We haue our eares beaten w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> continual doctrine wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>as our minds are voide &amp; barren of good mocions &amp; not touched w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Moreouer alſo there be ſome that here neuer the whole ſermon but here &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:18640:70"/> there a word or half a word rather with out regard. Wherfore Dauid ſaieth not without great cauſe, that he woulde go to the temple of the lord to viſit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great care &amp; diligence and the whole ſtudy of his minde. And doubtles the excellent treaſures of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of god which are therein ſet forth vnto vs, are moſt worthy to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eies of our minds wholy bent &amp; ſet thervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But as I haue now touched god would not haue vs to beholde theſe treaſures only to pleaſe our eies &amp; ſo to depart w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any profit. Let vs therefore vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of chriſt hath then ſhewed in vs her force &amp; fruit when our mindes life &amp; maners are ſo chaunged y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we can worſhip god purely &amp; ſerue him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out corruption. And this is it that Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uid ſaith. pſalm. lxxxiiii. That thei whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch dwell in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord ſhall prayſe him for euer. Wherfore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do we aſſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble our ſelues i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to one place? whi is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> goſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pel preached vnto vs? why do we vſe bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſme &amp; the lords ſupper but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god ſhuld be praiſed &amp; magnified by vs w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all kind of praiſes? the which praiſe ſtandeth not only in the lips, but continueth al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life
<pb facs="tcp:18640:70"/> long and floriſheth for euer. Therefore ſaith he in another place. I wil waſh my hands O lord in innocencie &amp; then wyll I enter vnto thyne altare. Now do we ſee what is the true &amp; lawfull vſe of all the order in the church, to wit, that we beyng diligently inſtructed therein may worſhyp God purely and as becometh hys ſeruaunts. In the olde time vnder the law thei that came to the temple to worſhip god, eſpecially the preiſtes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei ſhuld execute their office, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually waſhed them ſelues. This cere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mony in dede is paſſed awaye, but the truth that yet remaineth oght of vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be mainteyned and practiſed. And becauſe we nowe do knowe all the wais &amp; meanes, wherby we may atteyn to the moſt perfit &amp; pure worſhip of god wherefore we muſt enter and holde the way of life more warely the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others. For the more furtherance y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs by god, ſo much leſſe of excuſe ſhal be left onles we do appli y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame both vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to our vſe &amp; profite &amp; alſo to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of god. For if we do ſtumble by the waye it is not becauſe we doe not ſee a plain &amp; troden way before our fete. And
<pb facs="tcp:18640:71"/> if we do ſtray forth of the way &amp; wander without aſſuraunce, we can not blame god therfore as though he did not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſet vp the clear light of this word And if we do forget our dutie, this negli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gence &amp; forgetfulnes cometh not herof, that we not admoniſhed of god moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently called to all Chriſtian duetye: for god leaueth no meanes at all where in there may be any furtherance to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to holines, to ſaluacion. Therfore let vs fear y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rebuke which god vſeth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of his prophet Eſai. I haue daily ſtretched forth myne armes vnto a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne &amp; rebellious people. If thei which wander &amp; go aſtray by the deſert places of the papiſtrie and that horrible wilder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, ſhal not eſcape iuſt puniſhment and vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce becauſe thei haue not folowed the right waye, what maye we loke for which are broght vp &amp; noriſhed at home like children in the eyes of our heauenly father. Some hath leaft their moſt deare contrey and the place wherein thei wer borne &amp; broght vp, that thei might come to ſome chriſten church. Other hath got<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten a greater benefite &amp; as it wer a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>al prerogatiue, that it pleaſeth god to vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſit
<pb facs="tcp:18640:71"/> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their own countrey as it were in their own neſt. Nowe if thei that are borne here wil not acknowledge this ſo great fauour of god, &amp; meanes of ſaluaci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on moſt to be deſired and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thankefull minds &amp; mindful harts teſtifie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei may wholly giue &amp; conſecrat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues vnto god y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cometh ſo nigh vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can this ingratitude remaine vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed? Let them rather ſay thus: O Lord thou haſt here builded they temple &amp; ſet vp thine altar amongs vs: grant we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeche thee for thine euerlaſting goodnes and exceding mercy that grace vnto vs that we maye be purged in minde, life, and maners, that we do not polute thy holy gifts with the filthy ſpottes of our ſinnes &amp; ſo turne the excellent glorye of thy benefits into reproche &amp; ſhame. And thei which do come from far countreyes muſt be ware, wiſe, and diligent, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they do liue ſo godly &amp; blameles as becometh men in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe of god. Thei might haue liued in other places wildly &amp; wantonly neither ſhould thei forſake the papiſtrie for this end, that thei ſhuld leade a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lute life not comely for the goſpel in the church of god. And ſurely there be ſome
<pb facs="tcp:18640:72"/> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it had ben much better that thei had broken their neckes when thei ſet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> firſt fote forth of their dores, then that thei ſhuld entre into this churche to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue them ſelues therin ſo ſhamefully &amp; wickedly. Some linck themſelues with the ſcorners &amp; mockers, and ſo confirme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more &amp; more in their malice. Other do liue moſt rietouſly in meate &amp; drinke and al kinde of pleaſures. Some as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of all peace and concorde, couet no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing but diſcorde, debate and brallings And there be ſome families wherin the man &amp; wife do braule &amp; ſtriue like dogs and catts. And certein will ſeme yonge princes, encreaſing &amp; amplifiyng their ſtate without meaſure, geuen wholly to pompe, to coſtlynes, &amp; to exceſſe of thys worlde. And others are ſo idle ſo deynty ſo delicate, that thei can not tell what it is to labor, and yet no liuing can ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fie them. Finallye there be ſome ſklan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous backbiters which coulde fynde ſome faute euen with the verye angels: who ready to breſt with their manifolde vices, ſet all their holines only in thys, that thei requier a ſtrait accompte how their neighbors do liue, ſuppoſing that
<pb facs="tcp:18640:72"/> God is muche in their debt becauſe they are come to Geneua, as though it had not bene better for them, moſt filthyly to haue corrupted in their owne donge, then to geue ſuche offences in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of God.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if the lyfe by paſſed haue bene ful of ſuch vyces &amp; ſynnes, now let euery man take care and diligence that he conuert and beſtow all the reſidue of his tyme to a better, more ſobex and more honeſt kynde of lyfe.</p>
            <p>And yf there be any ſo hardened in their vices that they can by no meanes be corrected nor amended, yet the chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God muſte confirme and arme them ſelues with thys doctrine, that they be not corrupted or infected wyth the noughtye and wicked life of others. Verelye we oughte alwayes to take it heauenly and to lament, when we do ſee the Churche of GOD prophaned and defyled wyth ſo manye fylthy blottes and malicious wyckedneſſe: But ſeing that we muſte heare lyue conuerſaunt wyth the wycked as the Corne is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wyth the Chaffe, let vs ſuffer thys confuſion wyth all pacience and
<pb facs="tcp:18640:73"/> quietnes whiles that god ſhall take vs clean away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked. For it is no doubt but that this churche (wherin we are) is like a touch ſtone ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pointed to trie many men &amp; to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowen. How ſo euer the matter be let vs now bende our ſelfes to this minde &amp; purpoſe ſeing god by his wonderful and infinite mercy hath gathered vs home into his familie from that miſerable wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deryng, that we beſtow al our diligence vpon purenes of life innocency and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes, abhorryng from all polution of the worlde which maye ſpot or blemiſhe the profeſſion of an holy &amp; chriſten lyfe, that after we haue ended the courſe of this life, the Lorde Ieſus at that great and glorious day may acknowledge vs and accompte vs amonges that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that haue called vpon his name purely and truly without any vntruth or hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.</p>

Wherof we haue in this place an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple moſt worthy to be folowed. For Dauid was not fre nor voyde alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of thoſe perturbations of the minde whereby we are ſore enticed and driuen the contrary way: but he doutles was moued with ſuch tentations wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:18640:74"/> hys ſpirite myghte wander and go aſtray from God.</p>
            <p>Howe be it to fynde a remeady a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt al ſuch occaſions, wherby we fall from the feare of God and true holines, &amp; to keape the ſure waye, he doth onli re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>garde that which God doth declare vnto hym, that doth he meditate and ponder in his mind. And to declare this precepte &amp; admonition in few wordes, God doth ſtyre al the faithful and exhorte them to ſeeke his face. Nowe Dauid witneſſeth that he hath ſo aplied all his dilygence in obſeruing and keaping this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, that there is a goodly harmony co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent &amp; agreement betwixt god that thus ſpeaketh and commandeth: Seke ye my face, and him that anſwereth ſo, my lord I wyll ſeeke thee. But heare muſte we conſider, wherfore God putteth this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me face expreſſedly. For if he had no face but as it were a ſhewe and ſhadow of a face wherein he woulde ſhewe hymſelfe vnto vs, he ſhoulde dyſceaue vs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding vs, to ſeeke that whych colde not be founde nor perceaued in him. Yet am I not Ignorant that there be many whych wolde ſhewe the, ſharpenes of

Notwithſtanding thoſe that haue bene diligently exerciſed in the holy ſcriptures ſhall eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue that God woulde note forthe and declare a certain maner and order, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch he alwaes vſeth to ſhewe and offer himſelfe vnto men moſt familiarly. And certainly to name the ſanctuary and the arke of the couenante the face of God, is a kinde of ſpeache ſo, vſuall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune in the ſcripture, as any can be.</p>
            <p>And why ſo? Becauſe GOD who in his Nature and Maieſty is Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible findeth certayne meanes meete for the Weaknes and rudenes of men whereby he may bringe them vnto hym.</p>

It was no great matter as may appeare in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme of dauid to come to the temple, that men might ſe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ceremonies as there were done and celebrate. But if we rightlye conſidre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirituall exempler and pattern whiche was ſhewed vnto Moſes, we ſhall ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iudge it ſtrang nor without reaſon that God doth call it his face. For dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſeing chriſt was ther reuealed, what other thing can we ſay then that God of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fered himſelfe to be beholden and ſeene? Now let vs conſidre: Whether God do not order &amp; ſet forth vnto vs ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes wherby he may after a ſorte be ſene and felte of vs. It is verye true that he hath appeared in his ſon who is his liue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly image and in whom onlye he wyll be perfitely knowen. Yet neuertheles ſaint Paul declareth that the goſpell is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine glaffe wherin al men muſt behold and conſidre hym. Thee Sacramentes haue the ſame power and nature: final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the hole order Inſtitute in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che by hym, dothe ſhewe the ſame ſight vnto vs.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:18640:76"/>
            <p>Therfore let the proud braggers of this worlde mocke this order &amp; contemplacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god aſmuch as thei wil: yet ſeing that god dealeth ſo louingly and gently with vs, that he doeth ſubmit him ſelf by this meanes vnto vs, let not vs be aſhamed to render thys honour to his word &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, that we behold and ſe him in them as it were in the face. Not that we are reteined and holden in the elements of this world ſubiect to corruption lyke the papiſtes, who abuſeth theſe ſignes ſuperſticiouſly to ydolatrie, which God hath geuen vnto vs that we ſhoulde be broght by them vnto Ieſus Chriſt. But if we wil hereafter haue the fruition ful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly &amp; perfitely of that moſte comfortable preſence of god which is moſt to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, we muſte euen by this humble and lowe way and maner come vnto hym.</p>
            <p>Howe be it this that I ſaye is not ſo ſtraitly to be vnderſtande as though the faythfull dyd neuer approche or come neare vnto God ſaue then, when they come into the temple. For this opinion reſtynge and ſtyckyng to any certayne place were a ſuperſtition ouer foliſhe. But thus I do meane, that we may not
<pb facs="tcp:18640:76"/> ſet God oboue the cloudes (as certayne men do in their ſpeculations) thinkyng they can ſee hym when they ſhut theyr eyes imaginyng of hys diuine Maieſty, what ſoeuer commeth into our braines neglectyng bothe the preachyng of the Goſpell and alſo others ſuch lyke aides and helpes neceſſarily required to the knowledge and contemplacion thereof. For this is moſte true that thoſe which deſpyſe the vſe of the Sacramentes whereof I ſpeake and of all the order of the Churche, they diſdeygne to ſee GOD at that tyme when he doeth offer hym ſelfe to be ſene and beholden.</p>
            <p>Nowe let vs ſee howe neceſſarye this graue and vehement exhortacion and prouocation is vnto vs whereby GOD calleth vs vnto hym.</p>
            <p>We haue all ready ſpoken what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour loue and honour he doeth ſhewe vnto vs, when he doth cal vs ſo louyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and gently vnto hym that he maye worcke oure Saluacion, and that he maye bryng vs vnto the trewe and perfite felicitie from the whyche we
<pb facs="tcp:18640:77"/> are ſo farre away by nature. But this muſte we alſo marke and conſider that god doth pricke and moue vs by al mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to take hede that we fall not into miſerie. Firſt of al we haue eyes ſo wan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dering &amp; wanton, that it ſemeth a very miſerable caſe. For i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al this our life ther is nothing but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vanities of this world which do kepe all our ſenſes occupied, &amp; Satan hath infinite deluſions and thoſe moſt crafty, wherby he continually do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth circumuent and begyle vs. Althogh al his gyles and diſceats are none other thing, but certain foliſh viſers &amp; ſhewes triflyng and counterfaite pageants and iuglings of game plaiers. But experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth teach plainly howe foliſhe we are, howe mad and deſtitute of all ſenſe ſeyng that we ſuffer our ſelues ſo eaſly and ſo often tymes to be deluded and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiued. Wherfore yf we wer wiſe &amp; wel aduiſed this voyce ſhould ſounde conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in our eares. Seke my face. And what ſekee we? The more carefull and dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that god is in procuryng our ſal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uacion, we are the more careles &amp; ſlowe in folowyng after it. And would to god we were not like kicking and reſty hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb facs="tcp:18640:77"/> more ready to go backwarde then forward. Not withſtanding this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple is not ſet fotrh vnto vs i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vain. For this reuerent anſwere and proteſtation of Dauid that he did meditate this doctrine in his heart, wherby he and al the faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full are admoniſhed to ſeke the face of god doth declare vnto vs to what thing we ought to applye our ſtudy and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that god calling vs vnto him loſe his labour altogether vpon vs. And in this doctrine there be two poynts moſt worthy to be marked. The firſt is that ſo ſoone as God had thus ſpoken &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Seke my face: he anſwereth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> moſt earneſt affection vnto this worde. The ſecond is, that after he hath conſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted to the precept of god &amp; affirmed it, he promiſeth that he will ſeke the face of god in dede, in worke, &amp; diligence ſhewe the ſame.

For what libertie haue they to honour God in their famylyes &amp; houſes by any means? As for an example. If any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue a child borne, his deuty is to offre him to God w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> prayer &amp; thankesgeuing, and to require, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his bodi may be ſygned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> baptiſme which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſygne of ſaluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Now we do know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> baptiſme is ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papiſtri &amp; ſo defiled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtion &amp; pollution, that the child can not receiue it, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is ſtreight wais pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted &amp; defiled.

Wherfore thei which doute whether thei may rid themſelues forthe of this mire or rather forth of this helly pitte, vnder a certaine pretence of obedi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence vnto worldly prince, do peruerte al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of nature. For that lawfull pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er which God allowethe that we ſhulde make for our princes, is agreable and ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ray conuenient, both to their authoritie which he giueth them and alſo to the of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice wherwith he hath bound &amp; charged
<pb facs="tcp:18640:80"/> vs towardes them. Thus S. paul dothe exhort vnto prayers to be had and made for kings &amp; magiſtrates, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may lead a godly quiet &amp; peaceable life w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> honeſty &amp; the fear of god.

The miſerable Iewes in dede wer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to remain ſo long in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bondage of Babilon whiles y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time was fulfilled which was appointed of god to ſuffre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miſerable captiuiti: but let theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> talke ſo much of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s law and obedience, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue to do, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we chriſtians are bownd ſo far by like obedience, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of our own accorde we muſt depriue our ſelfes of thoſe ſpiritual benefites which god geueth moſt liberal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to his children. They do feele a great neceſſite wherew<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are ſoore preſſed, &amp; thei are greatly enticed by their owne infirmitie: but god ſheweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remedy for theſe ſo great euils. What is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe that thei deſpice theſe ſo great helpes &amp; benifites for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obedience &amp; ſeruice of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> take their bread forthe of their hands?
<pb facs="tcp:18640:81"/> The cauſe is greater of a man towarde his wife or of the wife towarde the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande. For ſeing that god hath ioyned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together into one fleſh, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not do well in any caſe to forſake the other vnder a certain colour to ſeke god. Not only that thei may not depart far a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to let the dutye betwixt man &amp; wife but that eueri one oght rather by al mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes and with all diligence to labor that he may draw and bring the felow &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panion of that holy lyfe to the worſhip of god. This then is the dutye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the one oweth to the other, that the huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d mai declare vnto the wife, how miſerable &amp; vnhappy thei are, becauſe thei want the holy company &amp; felowſhip of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfull becauſe thei are deſtitute of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes and ſermons (which are moſt ſure ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes, pledges &amp; teſtimonies &amp; be fully aſſured wherby we may know that god dwelleth amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs vs) again he muſte ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort her y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe do not diſpaire nor diſtruſt but truſt in gods mercies. And if he can not perſuade her nor win her ſo ſone as he wolde, let him neuer be wery whiles he haue gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his purpoſe. And althogh his wife do reſiſt his purpoſe moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,
<pb facs="tcp:18640:81"/> neuertheles let not the man ceaſe importunately to attempte the mater w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her, and to proue her minde by al means, vntyll ſhe do ſhew her lelfe wylfull and abſtinate in her wicked purpoſe. When he hath aſſaied and attempted all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may be doone by hym, yf he can tary there no longar, then is he free, and vtterly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from all the lawe of mariage and neceſſitie of tariyng: becauſe he hath done all his duety and nothing wanted of his part but that his wife might haue folowed him as her duety required. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh yet this departing of the man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wife is no diuorſe, but the houſband goeth before whither God calleth, that he may ſhew the wai to his wife. And as touching the maryed woman, ſhe is yet bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a more ſtrait bonde of mariage becauſe ſhe is the inferior, and muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thely acknowledge her houſband as her heade and reuerence hym.</p>
            <p>Therefore muſte ſhee by all meanes poſſyble, brynge her houſbande in to the mynde and meanes that he wyll reſtore and ſet them bothe at liberty.</p>
            <p>And when ſhee hathe doone all that euer ſhee canne, yet is ſhee not at lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:18640:82"/> and ſet fre, that ſhe may forſake him to whome ſhe is bounde and ſubiect, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſome perſecution be raiſed, wherein the danger is manifeſt, and ſpecially yf her owne huſbande be moſt ready to pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſue her vnto death: for then ſhe depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not from her huſbande, but ſhe auoi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth that euill that is prepared for her and the furious rage of her enemies whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch god permitteth and alloweth. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that great danger and violence which is intended towards her doth diſcharge her and deliuer her from the bonde of ſuche a bitter and dangerous lyfe: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding when al thinges are well wayghed &amp; conſydered no worldly cauſe ought either to withdrawe man or wyfe the one from the other, but onely that mutuall beneuolence, loue and charitie which the one oweth of dewtye to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ſaluation of the other.</p>
            <p>For if it be neceſſary that a man ſhoulde ſo forget himſelf that he ſhould haue no regarde of the thinges that pertayne to this earthly life and to the body, he oght alſo likewiſe to forget and contemne thoſe thinges which are about him.</p>
            <p>Therfore let vs retourne to that acount
<pb facs="tcp:18640:82"/> which Dauid maketh that the face of the Lorde ſhoulde be ſoughte as alſo he ſayeth in the .lxxxiiii. Pſalme, where he ſayeth it is better to lyue one day in the courtes of the Lorde, then a thouſande beyng therefrom: whereby he declareth that the lyfe of the faythfull can not be to ſhorte ſo that God graunt them this grace that whiles thei liue in this world they may exerciſe them ſelues in hys ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uice and honour, and eſtabliſhe themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues wyth his promiſes celebratyng hys name with all godly confeſſion &amp; praiſe. If a man obiect that this mai be done in ſome deſerte place or amongeſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes of the fayth. I anſwere that it is not wythoute cauſe that Dauid doeth ſpeake namely of the courts of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For he doeth conſider howe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary the order of the church is vnto mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men, ſpecially becauſe he knoweth their rude and weake nature, but if this oration and admonicion were ſo altoge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther fired in all mens heartes that all men woulde come at the leaſt to ſome chriſtian church where they myght dye quietly, and peaceably there woulde be none which would not eaſely and quick<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye
<pb facs="tcp:18640:83"/> gather vp their burden and prepare them ſelues. But what do we ſeke? Eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry man wyl lyue, and that with all eaſe and pleaſure, euery man in that kynde of pleaſure and luſte wherewith he is led and drawen. This is cauſe wherfore the church of god ſo much is contemned and reiected to day. Yea and there ar ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny wittie and ſubtell to inuent and ſet before their eyes ſuch lettes and hynde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances as may bring them from that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy of godlines that was in Dauid.</p>
            <p>Moreouer thei bring this in, what ſhall we profit ſay they, if we do chaunge pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces? Whether ſoeuer we go we ſhal find the worlde no leſſe then in our countrie. There is at this time a wonderfull cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of maners and of al things. All things ar full of offences te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tations and ſuch corruptions whereby mens minds may eaſely fal from the true fear of god to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of the worlde. I cofeſſe in dede that all thinges are as they both thinke and ſpeake. But if their body were in daunger &amp; they were admoniſhed where they might finde both learned and mete phyſicions and alſo propre &amp; healthefull remedies &amp; other helpes either to reſtore
<pb facs="tcp:18640:83"/> or preſerue their healthe then, I ſaye, they woulde not ſay that thei cared not for it or ſette lyght by it becauſe that in all places dyſeaſes may come vnto men. I graunt that in what place ſoeuer we be we ſhall finde infinite occaſions to do euelle, corruptions, and intiſemets of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde but ther is great difference whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther we haue ayds? helpes where with we maye other be kepte in office or eles hauing erred from our office maye be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtored or whether we be altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of them let it be agred that vices nowe doe reigne and are of lyke force in the worlde ſo that by ther poiſon the air is infected no leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a peſtilence: are we not in better condition the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue ſuch remedies as are geuen of God to his children, wherew<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may ether driue awaye from vs greuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes now coming and aſſauting or els purge and put them awaye being nowe preſente. Further more I thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> both the doctrine of the goſpell when it is purely preached and alſo the ſacraments when their lawfull vſe is kepte and alſo common praiers and other meanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydes, are alwaes very neceſſary to ſtyre
<pb facs="tcp:18640:84"/> vs vp and to admoniſhe vs that we be not infected with the corruptions and tentations of the worlde as it werewith certaine poiſons. Now all men do know that there is none of all theſe ſo great &amp; ſo holſome remedies and benefits in the papiſtry but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarywiſe all wickednes and extreme danger of loſſe of life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uation.

The mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerable ydolaters oght to make vs aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. For if any of them after he haue conſumed bothe his body in goyng a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh pilgrimage. when he commeth vnto that place whither he purpoſed, do finde an hoſte which doth aſke money of hym out of all reaſon, or verlets and cruell knaues which doth him iniurie, or coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous prieſts that beguyle hym, and to be ſhort finde nothyng there but confuſion and diſorder, yet are there no euyls nor diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities ſo great, that can change his purpoſe from this religion or rather ſuperſticion once begonne. For he wyll ſay that he is come thither for that cauſe that he maye worſhyp the body of ſome bleſſed Saincte, or ſome Image of oure Lady as they terme her, or ſome maner of reliques.</p>
            <p>And ſhall in verye dede the only ſyght of ſome carkas, or vile Idole, haue more force to cauſe the miſcreants that haue no faith, to continue obſtinate in theyr
<pb facs="tcp:18640:86"/> ſuperſtitions, then the face and preſence of god himſelfe to confirme vs and bring vs ſuch conſtancie as is neceſſarye to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after and attaine ſo great goodnes? If we do ſe this or that which may grief or trouble our myndes God calleth vs agayne vnto hym and wylleth vs in the beholdyng and lokyng vpon his face to receyue that comfort and pleaſure that we may beare paciently other diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dities. Wherefore let this be the ſhylde and refuge to all godly and faithful men that they cleaue continually lokyng vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face and countenance of god him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, howe ſo euer Satan labour &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to cary them away. And ſurely if we can verely and as we ought eſteme the face of god, we ſhal neuer accompte any hurt or damage in the loſſe of other thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges what ſoeuer we ſuffer. Though to ſay the truth, the greateſt part of them is not ſo much hindered by doubtfulnes of minde as by the want and diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of thoſe thynges that pertayne to the bodye: not but that the chyldren of God haue great and ſoore battails in their conſcience when they fynde theſe offencs wherof we haue ſpoken in thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:18640:87"/> churches that ar called reformed. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore thei that are determined to go vnto ſuch places wher the goſpell is preached muſt be admoniſhed befor of many &amp; gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uous offences &amp; muſt prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to ſuffer &amp; ouercome them: and thei that haue already taſted &amp; proued thoſe diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities &amp; impediments oght to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme themſelues moſt of all, that in deſpyte of Satan thei mai ſeke the face of god moſt conſtantly. But if al things ſhalbe tried &amp; conſidered aright there ſhalbe nothing found but very diſtruſt &amp; vnbeliefe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch hindereth the multitude and greateſt part of men. And as men are very witty to finde out excuſes, the riche men haue theyrs of one ſorte, and the poore bring theyrs alſo. How can it be ſayth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ryche man that I ſhould leaue al that I haue? Shuld I thus ſpoile my ſelf of all my ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches &amp; poſſeſſions? I haue a wife &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren we haue accuſtomed to liue at eaſe wythout any trauayle.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we do in a ſtrange countrey where we ſhall haue no rentes nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenewes? But the poore alledgeth of the contrarye: I haue in dede very lytle but I am amonges my frends by whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:18640:87"/> liberalitie my pouertye and neceſſitie is relieued.</p>
            <p>My labour is ſo well knowen and can not be wanted that I can heare lyue of my labour. What ſhall I do amonges ſtraunge and vnknowen men, hauynge neyther Halfepeny nor Farthyng, and ſhall be holpen by the acquaintaunce, frendſhyppe, fauour or reliefe of none? And it may be in dede that ſuche excuſes maye be partly trewe: And to reaſon no more aboute the matter that it is a thynge verye grieuous and vnpleaſant not onely to leaue the countrey where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou waſte borne, but alſo that place wherein by longe and familiar conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation there ſemeth, to be nowe gotten a certayne diſpoſition of nature.</p>
            <p>But all theſe yet imagine, howe they maye ſette before theyr eyes thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedimentes whereby they maye ſtoppe the waye whereby they ſhoulde come vnto GOD, that is to ſaye: Though they do not fynde the matters ſo harde and intricate as they make them: Yet wyll they couer them ſelues gladly wyth what clokes they can. And when they haue powred forth theſe greuous &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:18640:88"/> miſerable complaints they think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue ſtopped Gods mouth, and that he doth them great iniury if he ſtyll charge them as thogh he wolde compell them to thoſe things which were not poſſible to be done. Truly I haue nothing to an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwer to theſe things but that which is written in the pſalme .lxxxiiii. that is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the faithfull paſſing by the vallies and drye wildernes that want all water, wil digge themſelues pits and ciſterns. And I thinke this ſufficient to ouercome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that wyll not reſiſt God of obſtinate ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lice. Wherfore they that ſee themſelues ſo beſett wyth ſo great diſcommodities &amp; dangers that they can ſee no way nor pathe to go bi, muſt remembre that euen the deſerte places, wherein there is no droppe of water to be gotten oght not to let their iornay. And that we may vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtand this ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce more ſenſibly &amp; plaine<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, we muſt marke that Gods purpoſe is to be ſoght of his children, not by the gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>en medowes that may delite them with varietie of ſwete flowres, neither by the ſwete arbres and pleaſant ſhadoes: but by roughe and ſtiepe wayes by hils and dailes by ditches &amp; ſand pittes, by baren
<pb facs="tcp:18640:88"/> contreys and waſte wildernes: and all this is doone for that purpoſe that their faith may be exerciſed and that their fer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uent zele and deſyre to come vnto hym maye be prooued and tryde. Wherefore though we can not come vnto God, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we muſt paſſe by ſome wyldernes and waſte and wylde deſert by the way, let vs know that this is not the firſt tyme that God dealeth ſo wyth hys faithfull and let vs prepare our myndes and fully determi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to folow them who haue gone a longe tyme before vs.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe bothe the councel of god and the notable exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the godly that oght to be folowed, there ought to be in the children of God ſuch a zeale and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inde, that nothyng do draw them away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right worſhipping &amp; ſeruing of him. The which yet is ſene in verye few now a days: all are almoſt ſo delicat and deintye, that if there be but a mote in the way it may hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtil that they wyl not go forwarde. We can go no fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther ſay they. Why ſo? Becauſe thei wil take no pain to wraſtle out of a litle im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pediment. Verely the deſier of the minde is very feble that is weakened and ouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>com
<pb facs="tcp:18640:89"/> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo ſmal maters. For we oght not only not to be diſcouraged and as it wer ſtanding in a ſtay and vncertaine for the doutfulnes of the way ſo to periſhe, but we oght to be armed againſt all ſtayes &amp; impediments be thei neuer ſo great or many. To atteine hereunto we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waes keape this leſſon in remembrance that God knowledgeth none for his chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren, but thoſe that ſeeke him by drye &amp; baren places, &amp; digge them ceſterns wher not one droppe of water apeareth. By y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which wordes is ment and ſignified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs that no labor or grief oght to be ſo great, which we oght not to vndertake and to ſuffer that we may haue the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the face of God. Muſt there nedes be the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a place ſoght out, wherin we may haue libertie to worſhip and ſerue God purely? what paſſage ſo euer be offered, or how hard ſo euer the voyage be, yet notwithſtanding the iournai muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dertaken and accompliſhed. Shall we ſuffer hunger and thirſt by the way? yet mai we not faint in corage in ſuch want and neceſſitie, but moſte chearfully go forwarde. But let no man loke towards me, and fynde cauillations, as thogh I
<pb facs="tcp:18640:89"/> I dyd ſpeake of this matter in my great quietnes fealing no grief my ſelf. For it is the holy goſt that teacheth vs, that we oght rather to delue and dig in the earth then to decline or tourne awaye fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the voyage towardes the church of god that is moſt godly enterpriſed and begonne. Now if thei that dwell in farre contries and by worldly iudgement are excluded from all theſe meanes wherby they may come to that place where the Goſpell is preached, haue none excuſe, what muſte they loke for, who haue the goſpel with in their gates &amp; yet wyll not moue one fote forwarde to entrie into the churche of god? Sermons are preached daily and publike prayers are made alſo and they nede not paſſe only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breadeth of a ſtreat yet lo, euery one wyll ſaye that he hath ſome buſynes at home. And to be ſhorte many ſet their felicitie in thys poynt yf they can withdraw themſelues and hold them backe altogether fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god. For thei thinke themſelues then to haue gayned all, if thei haue gotten ſome light &amp; vain excuſe whereby they may flye away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the company of the godly &amp; the ſighte of god. Now becauſe of nature we do ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>horre
<pb facs="tcp:18640:90"/> god that we would fle from hym &amp; be abſent ſo far as wer poſſible, yea and then woulde ſeperate our ſelues the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth moſt near vnto vs: let vs pray vnto god y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wolde confirme vs in that mynde &amp; deſyre that we may ſo long continue and cherefully go forward in the iorney begonne whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les that we maye fynde there the lyuely fountaynes of ſaluacion where before we cold find nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g but extreme drought and want of waters. And though al this ſhuld want yet let vs digge ciſterns and wayt for raine from heauen: If it be not gods pleaſure that we ſhold fele his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fort ſo ſone let vs not yet ceaſe to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde with al diligence. But I am ſure that this thing will ſeeme very darke to many. But whence commeth this darke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes and difficultie but that it was neuer exerciſed practiſed nor put in experience? for we mai be taught a .M. yeres and yet not perceyue one worde of this doctrine, vntyll we haue learned by experience what it is to make a iornei by a drie and thyrſty waye when we ſhoulde come to god. Therfore this doctrine ought to be very familiar to al the faithful: to wit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei ſhuld prepare &amp; arme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
<pb facs="tcp:18640:90"/> againſt al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which ſatan ſhal enterpriſe by ani means to break of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iorney by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which thei ſhuld be broght to god. For ſurely whoſoeuer do beſtow their whole diligence faithfully in thys alone to wit, to ſeke out god, although thei ſtirre not out of the place in whiche they are, yet they ſhall finde many grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities which might turne them backe and call them to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parte, vnleſſe they had their mindes ſtable &amp; redy to reſiſt: but this is a thing to be lamented that the moſt part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I haue ſayd, are weakened and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by theſe difficulties that are offred to them by the waye. Thei will confeſſe forſoth that they oght thus to do. They ſhal ſeme to be ready and well prepared for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iorney, but when thei ſhuld go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward &amp; enter into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iornei the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their hart faileth them, &amp; thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are wel entred &amp; wel forward alſo, often tymes faile and are vtterly geue ouer euen in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wai. The more therfore oght this leſſon to be committed to our memory that we may digge pittes, that is, that we maye ſeke aides and helpes euen hyd and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen vnto vs, that we may ſtyll con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb facs="tcp:18640:91"/> procede and go forward. Let vs labour (I ſaye) and contende aboue all mans powre. If things com not to paſſe as we woulde, yet let vs not ceaſe to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſtil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good courſe wherein god hath ſet vs. It is moſte certaine that he if we cal vpon him in faith can tourne the dry wildernes into fountaines. But in the meane ceaſon it is meete accordynge to our dutie that we not ydled, nor lye ſtyll as thogh we wanted the ſence and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng of armes and legges. Yea verelye God commaundeth vs that we ſhuld ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther dig pittes. Let vs then labor in this diggyng ſo longe, whiles we haue fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed our iorney begonne. Let vs ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes the miſerable condition of ſoudiours which euery moneth ſet forth their lyfe to the ſale. If they be in the campe no man is able ſufficiently to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe what incommodities and miſeries they ſuffer: If they be beſieged in any place then they endure yet moche more greiuous things. If a voiage be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken that they ſhoulde go to any place, they can neither be let nor ſtayed by any colde or heate wynde or rayne from the iorney appointed and the enterpriſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne.
<pb facs="tcp:18640:91"/> And ſome times thei are brought to ſuch extremitie that onles they digge the earth to gett water, they haue not a droppe of water to drinke. There is no labor diſtreſſe nor miſery ſo great, which they wyll not ſuffer to atteine to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch they haue purpoſed and vndertaken. And yet when they haue doone and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered all whether they eſcape or be ſlaine they haue loſt all this their diligence &amp; labor, becauſe in the ſuffering of all theſe ſo great miſeries thei only ſerue Satan.

As for the cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cumſtance of the tyme wherein it was made it doth not make a litle to the vnderſtanding of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pſalme. For although the people of Iſrael were come agayne from the bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhement of Babilon &amp; the church of God gathered were nowe made one bodye after that long ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:18640:99"/> &amp; the temple and the altar did ſtande yea and gods worſhyp was reſtored: but becauſe there was but a verye lytle portyon of men lefte of a greate multytude the ſtate of the church was lowe and without honour yea and that lytle reſidue was dayly made leſſe and leſſe by the enemyes, the church alſo their temple was nothing ſo beautifull as the former temple and fynallye there was nowe almoſte no cauſe lefte, wherefore they coulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any good hope. And ſurely it ſemed vnpoſſible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they could euer haue rayſed vp them ſelues to the former ſtate from the whych they were fallen. Wherefore it was daungerous leaſte they ſhoulde be ouercome either to the former mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerye or els for the preſent calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhoulde be oppreſſed and fall downe and ſo at length y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mindes of the faithfull ſhould fall into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire. Wherefore leaſt they ſhould faint and lie downe vnder ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamites the Lorde dothe promiſe that they ſhall not onely recouer
<pb facs="tcp:18640:99"/> that which they had loſt, but alſo lifteth them vp into the hope of an incomparable glorye according to that prophecy of Aggeus. The glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye of the ſeconde temple ſhall be greater then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of the firſt.</p>
            <p>Now laſt of al it remaineth that we learne to apply this pſalme al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo to our profite. And ſurelye this comfort ought to haue bene of ſuch force to the godly men of that age, that they ſhoulde in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not onely haue ſtand vpright but alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei ſhuld haue lift the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues vp to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> though they were in the graue but vnles at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent daye our fathers experience ioyned with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words do confirme our faith ſo much the more we are more then ingrat ſince we know that all is fulfilled that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the holy ghoſt hath ſpoken for it can not be inough expreſſed for the worthines thereof how beauti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fully ſhe did deck the church at his commyng. For then the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which afore was ſhutte vp in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtraits of Iury was ſpred abrode
<pb facs="tcp:18640:100"/> through al the worlde. Then God which afore was knowen but of one familie began to be called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diuers tonges of al nations. Then the world which afore was torne in peecis miſerally with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ſectes of ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; errours was vnited in the holye vnitye of faith. Then all gathered them ſelues to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes whome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they abhorred. The kyngs of the earth and nations did willing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly obey Chriſt. The wolues and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were chaunged into lambes. The giftes of the holy gooſt were powred vpon the faythfull which did excell al the glory of this world al beautiful things and all riches. The body of the church being won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derfully gathered out of countreis far diſtant increaſed &amp; preſerued. The ſpreading of the goſpell in ſo ſhort time was vncredible ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being ioined with, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruite there of no leſſe notable. Wherefore if the dignitie of the church had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bene declared by this Prophet yet that notable and vncompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:18640:100"/> condition of that Golden age doth euidentlye declare that it is truly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauenly kingdom of god.</p>
            <p>But it was neceſſarye that the faythfull ſhoulde haue a hier taſte then by the iudgement of the fleſh in eſtemynge the dygnytye of the churche for when it dyd moſte flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe it did not ſhyne wyth purple golde or pearles but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the bloode of martyrs. Ryche ſhe was with the holye Ghoſte neuertheles ſhe was poore and lacked the earthely goodes: ſhe was noble and honora<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble both before God and angels by holynes but ſhe was contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the worlde. There were ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye outwarde and open enemies whych dyd either cruelly rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt: her or els dyd by ſutle craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes inuent wicked thinges againſt her. And within ther was nothing but terrors and priuy tranes: fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vnder the croſſe of Chriſt ther laye yet hid in honorable dignitye but it was ſpirituall. Wherefore the conſolation whych is in this Pſalme was then alſo in due time
<pb facs="tcp:18640:101"/> that the faithfull might riſe vp in their minds to a more perfect ſtate of the church. But our cauſe is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. Therefore it is come to paſſe by the faut of our fathers that that faire forme of the church hath line vnder the feete of the wicked defor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med and fylthy. And at this tyme being ouerladed with our ſynnes, doeth mourne vnder miſerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction vnder the deryſyon and mockyng of the deuel &amp; the worlde vnder the crueltye of tyrauntes, vnder the vniuſte ſlaunder of her enemies: ſo that there is nothing leſſe deſired of the children of the world which would that all went wel with them then to be counted the people of God. Whereby the profit of this pſalme is better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and alſo howe neceſſary the continuall medytatyon thereof is. <hi>To the ſonnes of Corah,</hi>

But howe harde an expoſition it were though I ſhould houlde my peace yet euery one may ſee. Some of the Iewes alſo thought nothing more likely then to refer it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pſalme. And ſo by a metapher they expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it the foundacyons of the matter (of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pſalme) bycauſe he intreateth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy citie of Ieruſalem which was ſet in the mountaines. But me thinke the true and right mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is that God hath choſen the holy mountaines in the which he ſhoulde found his owne citie. For
<pb facs="tcp:18640:102"/> it foloweth a litle after in the text <hi>The moſt hieſt ſhal eſtabliſhe it.</hi>

            <p>He is alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> builder of other citys but we neuer reade that he ſaid of any other citie. This is mi reſting place for euer, I will dwell here, bycauſe I haue choſen it, in the Pſalme. cxxxii.</p>
            <p>For we muſt alwayes put this dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ference that though other cities as touchynge the outwarde pollicie were made by the power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of god, yet Ieruſalem was his peculier holye place and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſeate. After the ſame faſhion doth Iſayas ſpeake Chapter .xiiii. Yea, and though all Iewry was holy vnto God, yet it is ſayd that he hauyng caſt all other aſide hath choſen thys to him ſelfe, in the which he might raigne. Which is expreſſed in the ſeconde verſe.</p>
            <p>The Lord loueth the gates of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aboue all the dwellynges of Ia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cob. To the which that anſwereth which is written in the Pſalme. lxxviii. That God hath forſaken Sylo, the Tribe of Ephraim, the
<pb facs="tcp:18640:102"/> tabernacle of Ioſeph, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might dwel in Sion which he had loued. Furthermore the Prophete doth declare the cauſe wherefore God doth preferre one place to another and he ſetteth the cauſe not in the worthineſſe of the place, but in the onely loue of God without meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Therefore yf any aſke why Ieruſalem doth excell the reſt, let a briefe anſwere be inough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſo pleaſed God. And thys was the begynnyng of the loue of GOD: but the ende was, that there might be a certaine place in the which trewe religion might remayne vnto the commynge of Chriſt, to the intent that the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of faith might be noriſhed, and from whence afterwarde trew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould flow to all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coaſtes of the worlde.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Prophete doth prayſe Ieruſalem with this title, that it hath God for a chiefe buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and chiefe gouernour. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he aſcribeth al the dignitie whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch it hath before other places to
<pb facs="tcp:18640:103"/> the grace and adoption of god.

            <p>Commonlye they take the hylles for Sion and Moriah: which I do not reiect, though it may be dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen further, becauſe the countrey was full of mountaines rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and the Citie was ſet in an hie place.</p>

            <p>Worde for word it is, that that is ſaid in the are wonderful thinges.</p>
            <p>But we muſt conſider the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of the prophet or rather the pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe of the holy gooſt ſpeaking by the mouth of his prophet. When as the ſtat of the people was lowe and contemptible and many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſe aduerſaries did riſe againſt them on euery ſyde and but fewe had the courage to ouercome the lettes, and daye by daye ſome new alteration did ariſe vnloked for &amp; it was daungerous leſt theynges

            <p>Here is a mete prop ſet vnder it that is to ſaye that God hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken otherwiſe of the ſtate thereof which is to come. For it is not to be douted but that they are called from the ſight of thinges preſent vnto the promiſes which did mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter hope of an vncredible glory. Therefore though nothyng apear wherof one may much reioyce, yet the prophet biddeth the children of God to ſtande vp as it were in a watchtowre and patientlye waite for the thinges that are promiſed. On this maner were the faithfull admoniſhed fyrſt that they might geue eare to the olde oracles, and call them to minde ſpecially thoſe which are written in Iſay, from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> xl. chap. vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boke, &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlye that they might barken to

<pb facs="tcp:18640:106"/> ſame maner of ſpeache is fained or at leaſte one which draweth neare to this which is here.

            <p>For although by nature they were not borne of Zion but ought to be grafted in by adoptyon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bodye of the holye people: yet becauſe our entrye into the church is the ſecond birth, this ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner of ſpeakyng doth agre very well.

And ſurely we are borne a new in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauenly life none other way then by the miniſtery of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch.
